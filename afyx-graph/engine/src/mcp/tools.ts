 * has no default project to fall back to — a gateway server started outside any
 * repo, or a monorepo root whose `.afyx-graph/` indexes live only in sub-projects
 * — every call MUST carry an explicit `projectPath`, so the schema should say so.
 * A `required` field is a HIGH-salience channel (MCP clients surface and often
