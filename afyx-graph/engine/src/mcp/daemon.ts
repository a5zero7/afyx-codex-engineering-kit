/**
 * Shared MCP daemon (issue #411).
 *
 * A project gets exactly one detached `afyx-graph serve --mcp` daemon, and
 * every concurrent MCP client attaches to it over a Unix-domain socket (a
 * named pipe on Windows). Each accepted connection becomes its own
 * {@link MCPSession}, but all sessions on a given daemon share one
 * {@link MCPEngine} — one file watcher, one SQLite WAL writer, one
 * tree-sitter warm-up, paid once and amortized across every attached agent.
 *
 * Lifecycle notes (the fuller picture lives in `./index.ts` and `./proxy.ts`):
 *   - Spawned **detached**: its own session/process group, stdio decoupled,
 *     by whichever launcher first finds nothing listening. It is not a child
 *     of any MCP host, so one terminal closing (or one session's Ctrl-C)
 *     can't sever the others — which is also why this process runs with no
 *     PPID watchdog of its own: outliving every individual client is the point.
 *   - Hosts never talk to this process directly; they talk to a thin `proxy`
 *     that pipes to it. The proxy keeps the #277 PPID watchdog, so a
 *     SIGKILL'd host still gets reaped promptly, and that proxy's socket
 *     close decrements this daemon's connected-client count.
 *   - Once the last client leaves, the daemon lingers for
 *     `AFYX_GRAPH_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (300s by default) before exiting —
 *     long enough that back-to-back agent runs in the same project reuse a
 *     warm engine instead of repaying startup, short enough that a
 *     single abandoned session doesn't leak a daemon forever (#277).
 *
 * Owned here: the listening socket and per-connection session spawn, the
 * version-gated hello handshake, the `.afyx-graph/daemon.pid` lockfile
 * (atomic create, no empty-file window, cleanup on exit), the connected-client
 * refcount and idle/inactivity timeout, and graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT.
 *
 * NOT owned here: the proxy side (`./proxy.ts`), the decision of whether to
 * run as a daemon at all (`MCPServer` in `./index.ts`), and the MCP protocol
 * state machine itself (`./session.ts`).

 * The fix (now shared as {@link acquireAtomicLockfile}) writes the complete
 * record to a private temp file first, then hard-links it into place —
 * `link()` is atomic AND exclusive (EEXIST when the target already exists),
 * so the target becomes visible in one step, already holding a full record.
 * There is no empty-file window left to hit.
 *
 * Filesystems without hard links (#997) — ExFAT/FAT external volumes, some
 * network mounts — can't `link()` at all (ENOTSUP/EPERM), which would
 * otherwise kill the daemon before it ever reached the socket bind.
 * {@link acquireAtomicLockfile} falls back there to an O_EXCL create (still
 * "first writer wins", but the record lands through the fd in a second step,
 * reopening a narrower empty-file window only on those filesystems, only for
 * the few microseconds between create and write). The worst case there is
 * two daemons briefly — strictly better than the daemon never starting.
