/**
 * Afyx Graph MCP server.
 *
 * Exposes Afyx Graph's code-intelligence functionality as Model Context
 * Protocol tools for AI assistants.
 *
 * @module mcp
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MCPServer } from 'afyx-graph';
 *
 * const server = new MCPServer('/path/to/project');
 * await server.start();
 * ```
 *
 * `MCPServer.start()` picks one of three runtime modes:
 *
 * - **Direct** — one process serves one MCP client over stdio. This is the
 *   original pre-#411 shape; it's used when the operator opts out
 *   (`AFYX_GRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1`), no `.afyx-graph/` is reachable, or the daemon
 *   machinery fails for any reason.
 * - **Proxy** — what an MCP host actually talks to whenever sharing is on: a
 *   thin stdio↔socket pipe to the shared daemon, carrying its own #277 PPID
 *   watchdog so a SIGKILL'd host still reaps its proxy promptly. See
 *   {@link ./proxy.ts}.
 * - **Daemon** — a detached background process (its own session/process
 *   group) serving N proxies over one Unix-domain socket or named pipe,
 *   sharing a single Afyx Graph engine + watcher + SQLite handle. Spawned on
 *   demand, never a child of any host, so it survives individual sessions
 *   and is reaped by client-refcount + idle timeout. See {@link ./daemon.ts}
 *   and issue #411.
 *
 * The detached-daemon-plus-always-proxy split exists because the original
 * in-process daemon (a) was the first host's own child, so closing that
 * terminal severed every other attached client, and (b) had its PPID
 * watchdog disabled, regressing #277 (an orphaned daemon surviving a
 * SIGKILL'd host).
