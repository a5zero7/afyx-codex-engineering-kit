/**
 * Git Worktree Awareness
 *
 * An Afyx Graph index lives in a `.afyx-graph/` directory and is resolved by
 * walking up parent directories to the nearest one. That walk is unaware of
 * git worktrees: when a worktree is created *inside* the main checkout (e.g.
 * some tools place them under `.gitignore`d paths like
 * `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`), a command run from the worktree walks up and
 * silently resolves the MAIN checkout's index.
 *
 * Every query then returns results from the main tree's code — usually a
 * different branch — rather than the worktree the user is actually editing.
 * Symbols added or changed only in the worktree are invisible. This module
 * detects that "borrowed index" situation so callers can warn about it.
 * Detection is best-effort: when git is unavailable or the path isn't a repo,
 * it reports "no mismatch" and callers carry on unchanged.
 */
