# Afyx v1 Master Roadmap

Status: **V1 FINALIZATION ACTIVE — unified Alpha source promoted; expanded v1 acceptance pending**
Canonical since: **2026-10-03**  
Contract revision: **2026-10-27 (v1 finalization rebaseline)**
v1 scope policy: **FROZEN AS EXPANDED BELOW — Phase 1 through Phase 11, Forge Track A, Platform Track B, Expert acceptance, and T12**
Post-v1 policy: **PLANNED EXPANSION — not a v1 release blocker**

Current work: **Complete remaining v1 component and integration acceptance without weakening Forge, evaluator, or release gates**
Task: execute the evidence-gated critical path defined in the 2026-10-27 finalization contract; source promotion and artifact signing remain separate release checkpoints

Workspace boundary: `D:\Project\workspace\afyx-codex-engineering-kit` is the canonical and exclusive development repository for implementation, source changes, fixes, benchmarks, development tests, documentation, versioning, commits, builds, and release preparation. `D:\Project\afyx-alpha` is restricted to clean-install, update, installed-identity, and post-install smoke/acceptance testing. Any defect observed there must be reproduced and fixed in the canonical repository, rebuilt there, and then reinstalled or updated for acceptance. This rule applies to T01-T12 without changing their scope, gates, or recorded history; the detailed contract is in the Alpha integration roadmap.

## 2026-10-27 authoritative v1 finalization contract

This revision records the owner's final product-scope decision:

> **Standalone by Design, Integrated by Contract — Sendiri Kuat, Bersama Solid.**

It supersedes only forward-looking statements that classified Forge Track A or
Platform Generalization Track B as post-v1 or nonblocking. Historical decisions,
dates, evidence, limitations, and `NOT_RUN` results below remain valid records and
must not be rewritten as if the expanded scope had always applied. Track C and
Track D remain post-v1 except for a demonstrated correction required by a v1 gate.

Stable v1 now requires applicable acceptance for Afyx Graph, Afyx Context, Afyx
Forge, Odoo Engineering, Afyx Engineering Expert, Track B, Phases 8–10, and T12.
Technical Alpha promotion/signing is a checkpoint, not evidence that these later
gates pass and not permission to publish.

### Status vocabulary

The following states are distinct and cannot substitute for one another:

- `SOURCE_READY`: implementation exists in the canonical source and affected
  focused checks pass.
- `STANDALONE_ACCEPTED`: the component's independent execution, failure, recovery,
  ownership, and packaging contract passes on applicable supported platforms.
- `INTEGRATION_ACCEPTED`: versioned cross-component contracts and graceful
  degradation pass without making optional components mandatory.
- `RELEASE_READY`: all expanded v1 gates, installed-product acceptance, artifact
  provenance, Phase 10 exit, and Phase 11 checks pass.

Jira status remains tracking metadata. A `Done` issue is reusable evidence for its
declared boundary, not proof of later combined acceptance; an `In Progress` issue
does not prove missing source.

### Baseline and immutable boundaries

| Identity | Current verified value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Development | `96eb101535b10e6329b106a9b1815c8152e76272` | Unified DEV after AFYX-283 Case A disclosure/telemetry gate |
| Alpha | `ff54a07c3264a39c55f49813da6020fd8286072b` | Promoted source; tree `dad055293008bfdb8de0c8953aacd796964b5e3b` |
| Main | `ce1e020a89095cc32130056440245e2ef101448f` | Stable workflow baseline; no expanded-v1 release implication |
| Signed historical Alpha artifact | artifact `12631346917` | Immutable evidence for prior Alpha source only; never substitute for `ff54a07c...` |
| PR #113 Graph-only Technical Alpha path | workflow head `36bb6ee75bc8a2bd536ce4960bfae3723143edbe` | Prepares an exact-source Afyx Graph build/attestation for `ff54a07c...`; no dispatch or new artifact exists from that PR yet |
| T12 Unified Kit candidate | `NOT_BUILT` | Future signed, installed candidate containing the accepted five-component Kit and Track B contracts |
| Forge formal campaign | `0/36 NOT_RUN` | A6/A7 evidence absent; A8 has no GO |

PR #105 and PR #113 remain separate owner-controlled publication/workflow work.
This roadmap does not authorize their merge, workflow dispatch, tag, release,
publication, deployment, or installed-runtime mutation.

The Graph-only artifact path prepared by PR #113 proves only the exact Afyx Graph
source/build/provenance contract declared by that workflow. T12 requires a later
signed **Unified Kit** candidate installed from one frozen identity after Graph,
Context, Forge, Odoo Engineering, Expert, and Track B have satisfied their
applicable gates. The Graph-only artifact cannot satisfy T12 component/integration
acceptance, and the future T12 artifact cannot retroactively replace the Graph-only
Technical Alpha evidence. Their manifests, subjects, checksums, installation
records, and acceptance verdicts remain separate.

### Five-component standalone and integration readiness

| Component | Implemented source | Standalone status | Integration status | Release-blocking gap | Reusable evidence / Jira |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Afyx Graph | Native extraction/runtime, CLI/MCP, persistence, installer/provider surface, exact-source packaging | `SOURCE_READY`; broad accepted component/security/resource evidence exists | Graph–Context optional/default-OFF consumer and fallback are implemented | Representative Phase 8 matrix, Phase 9/T12 installed-product acceptance, and exact final artifact evidence | AFYX-5; AFYX-58/59/62/63; AFYX-137; AFYX-249; exact Alpha CI |
| Afyx Context | Native standalone package, bounded selection, recovery, owner/session references, coordination | `SOURCE_READY`; standalone focused suite and build evidence accepted | Real Graph consumer, exact fallback/recovery, and combined dogfood pass; remains optional/default OFF | Demonstrate useful selective workloads without unsupported savings claim; installed T12 and resource bounds | AFYX-290–297; AFYX-8; net-recovery regression remains disclosed |
| Afyx Forge | A0–A4 contracts/candidates, public controller/orchestrator, synthetic isolation and portability controls | Public implementation and synthetic validation complete | Production integration is intentionally absent pending A8 | Independent runtime/evaluator/bundle/budget approvals, formal 36-cell A5–A7 evidence, A8 decision, then A9–A12 if GO | AFYX-12; AFYX-88–100; AFYX-171–188; AFYX-285/286/288 |
| Odoo Engineering | Distinct Odoo 10–20 domain skill, lifecycle/routing contracts, accepted component behavior | `SOURCE_READY`; component contract exists independently of Expert/Forge | Expert composition was observed in development evidence | Installed-product routing on representative Odoo work, domain correctness in independent Expert acceptance, and T12 | Existing Odoo Engineering contract; T05 historical deferral; AFYX-283 composition evidence |
| Afyx Engineering Expert | Native adaptive skill, harness/isolation corrections, Odoo composition, Case A disclosure and missing-telemetry fail-closed gate | `SOURCE_READY`; implementation and focused regression evidence exist | Routing contract exists; D.5 is input evidence only | Independent D.6 `KEEP/REVISE/REJECT`, controlled comparative acceptance, bounded references/tools, then T12 | AFYX-283; related AFYX-67/68; DEV commits `7b5acc8`, `ae9eff8`, merge `96eb101` |

No component may claim `RELEASE_READY` from source or synthetic evidence alone.
Odoo Engineering remains a distinct domain skill and must not be folded into
Expert or Forge merely to simplify packaging or reporting.

### Unified Kit integration contract

Every component must first pass its standalone contract. Integration then uses
versioned, independently testable boundaries:

1. Graph remains authoritative for repository intelligence and must operate when
   Context, Forge, Expert, or a secondary provider is absent.
2. Context is optional and default OFF unless a measured workload justifies opt-in;
   unavailable, malformed, incomplete, timeout, or recovery failure returns the
   exact authoritative input where that contract permits fallback.
3. Expert owns cross-disciplinary routing; Odoo Engineering owns Odoo-specific
   release/domain facts. Routing must load the minimum justified references and
   report missing telemetry as unknown/failure, never observed zero.
4. Forge may allocate engineering behavior only after A8 GO and accepted A9/A10;
   it never bypasses Graph truth, component ownership, evaluator isolation, or
   validation hard gates.
5. Track B adapters translate provider capabilities/configuration at the edge.
   Core task, context, evidence, diagnostics, recovery, and ownership contracts
   remain provider-neutral.
6. Optional failure degrades locally: no optional dependency may corrupt another
   component's state, mutate user-owned configuration, leak private evidence, or
   leave an owned subprocess/orphan behind.
7. Correctness, security, provenance, and data integrity are hard gates. Context,
   token, latency, memory, subprocess, and tool use must be bounded and measured
   where material; unavailable provider billing counters remain `NOT_RUN`.

### Forge Track A A0–A12 completion plan

| Gate | Current evidence | Required completion |
|---|---|---|
| A0 Evaluation Freeze | COMPLETE | Preserve frozen categories, fixtures, order, hashes, hard gates, and sanitized schema |
| A1 Capability Harvest | COMPLETE within recorded public inputs | Reopen only for a concrete source/contract change |
| A2 Capability Matrix | COMPLETE within recorded inputs | Preserve historical unavailable-input limitations |
| A3 Deduplication/Refinement | COMPLETE | Preserve Afyx-owned provenance and candidate independence |
| A4 Candidate Construction | IMPLEMENTATION/CANDIDATE PREPARATION COMPLETE; ACCEPTANCE PENDING where applicable | Preserve AFYX-92 and AFYX-178 `In Review`; reverify exact Route B B0–B5 identities immediately before an authorized campaign. This is not formal candidate acceptance or A8 GO |
| A5 Benchmark Harness | Public controller/orchestrator and synthetic tests complete | Owner-approved isolated runtime, evaluator-only bundle, custody, budgets, and one formal 36-cell execution |
| A6 Quality Gate | `NOT_RUN` | Independent correctness, task fidelity, evidence quality, and security verdicts for every required cell; no fabricated PASS |
| A7 Efficiency Gate | `NOT_RUN` | Compare only quality-passing cells using available context/token/tool/time/resource evidence; no unsupported superiority claim |
| A8 Architecture Decision | `NO DECISION` | Evidence-bound `GO`, `NO-GO`, or bounded redesign decision. Schedule pressure cannot force GO |
| A9 Forge Implementation | BLOCKED by A8 | If GO, implement only the selected behavior/architecture behind independent contracts; if NO-GO, record redesign or owner scope decision |
| A10 Adaptive Directive | BLOCKED by A9 | Demonstrate risk/evidence-based allocation with conservative ceilings and deterministic overrides |
| A11 Dogfood/Optimization | BLOCKED by A10 | Representative real engineering use; fix measured defects/waste without weakening hard gates |
| A12 Stable Forge Contract | BLOCKED by A11 | Freeze standalone/API/config/recovery/security behavior and cross-component compatibility |

Private evaluator material, holdouts, rubrics, canaries, credentials, and protected
evidence remain outside developer and evaluated-agent boundaries.

### Platform Track B nomenclature and B0–B7 crosswalk

`B0`–`B5` inside Forge A4 are **candidate IDs**, not Platform Track B phases.
To prevent ambiguity, this roadmap uses `TB0`–`TB7` for Platform Track B while
preserving the legacy Jira identities and titles AFYX-101–108. Existing issues
must be updated in place; no duplicate issues may be created merely to adopt the
`TB` prefix. AFYX-53/56 remain broader provider/control-plane evidence, not
replacements for the legacy Track B issues.

| Canonical planning label | Legacy Jira identity and preserved title | Expanded-v1 conceptual use |
|---|---|---|
| TB0 | AFYX-101 — B0 — v1 Platform Contract Freeze | Freeze Codex → Google Antigravity/Gemini → Claude Code priority, ownership, actual host surfaces, and non-goals |
| TB1 | AFYX-102 — B1 — Provider-Neutral Core Contracts | Remove provider branching from core decisions while preserving standalone behavior |
| TB2 | AFYX-103 — B2 — Stable ProviderAdapter Contract | Version inspect/plan/apply/verify/uninstall/capability/diagnostic behavior and fail closed on unknown capability |
| TB3 | AFYX-104 — B3 — Capability Discovery / Negotiation | Report actual CLI/editor/MCP/skill/config capabilities; absence remains explicit |
| TB4 | AFYX-105 — B4 — Provider-Neutral Task / Context / Evidence Contracts | Keep task/result/evidence schemas neutral and translate only at adapters |
| TB5 | AFYX-106 — B5 — Additional Provider Integrations by Measured Demand | Deliver required v1 Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, and Claude Code integrations only for supported capabilities |
| TB6 | AFYX-107 — B6 — Cross-Provider Validation / Hardening | Apply bounded ownership, rollback, degraded-mode, diagnostics, and applicable 3OS validation |
| TB7 | AFYX-108 — B7 — Stable Generalized Platform | Freeze adapter compatibility and pass the T12 provider matrix without regressing Codex |

This is a **conceptual planning crosswalk**, not a declaration that each expanded
TB gate is one-to-one equivalent to the historical Jira issue's original scope or
acceptance state. Historical issue titles, descriptions, status, comments, and
evidence remain authoritative for their original boundary. Expanded-v1 obligations
must be recorded as additive acceptance on the existing issue or its already-linked
children, without rewriting past completion claims.

Provider acceptance is capability-based, not false feature parity:

- Codex: current primary CLI, skill lifecycle, MCP registration/verification, and
  ownership-safe configuration remain the reference integration.
- Google Antigravity/Gemini: accept the actual workspace skill/config/MCP surfaces
  exposed by the supported host; current repository evidence covers workspace MCP
  ownership and excludes Codex-only Usage Tracking.
- Claude Code: implement and validate only its supported project instruction,
  skill/command, MCP, and diagnostics surfaces. Missing host capabilities must be
  reported as unsupported rather than emulated through unsafe global mutation.

AFYX-294 defines six concrete editor/CLI acceptance surfaces that Track B must
carry forward independently rather than compressing into a single "provider
works" claim:

| AFYX-294 acceptance surface | Preserved observed state | Track B use |
|---|---|---|
| Codex isolated MCP | PASS | Codex MCP registration, reachability, ownership, and isolation reference |
| Antigravity shared configuration/read-back | PASS | Configuration merge/read-back evidence only; not full host-mediated acceptance |
| Antigravity `agy mcp list` | PASS | CLI-visible MCP discovery surface |
| Codex agent-mediated query | BLOCKED (`401`) | Requires authorized provider/session acceptance; configuration evidence cannot substitute |
| Antigravity agent-mediated query | BLOCKED (`429`) | Requires authorized provider/session acceptance; rate/provider limitation remains explicit |
| IDE UI | `NOT_RUN` | Requires separately executed supported-editor acceptance; never infer from CLI/config PASS |

Claude Code must receive equivalent capability-appropriate coverage after TB1/TB2,
but AFYX-294 does not claim or retroactively supply Claude evidence.

TB5 source checkpoint (2026-10-27): the `ProviderAdapter/v1` registry includes
Claude Code with independently declared CLI and IDE surfaces, user/project
instruction and skill scopes, and ownership-safe MCP lifecycle mapping (`global`
to Claude `user`, `workspace` to Claude `project`). Discovery and planning remain
read-only; caller assertions and executable presence remain `UNVERIFIED`; apply
and uninstall require explicit consent and use bounded native CLI calls with
configuration read-back, Afyx ownership markers, rollback, and foreign-entry
preservation. Native state remains in `~/.claude.json` by default and relocates
to `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/.claude.json` only under an explicit override; effective
identity checks honor Claude's `local` → `project` → `user` precedence. Claude
MCP `local` scope is inspected but intentionally not managed. Authenticated CLI, bundled
VS Code CLI, IDE UI, and agent-mediated acceptance remain `NOT_RUN` pending an
authorized host. TB6 must validate cross-provider degraded modes and applicable
live acceptance without treating source implementation as provider acceptance.

TB6 cross-provider acceptance matrix (2026-10-27). `PASS` below is limited to
the named evidence surface; fixture/CI evidence never substitutes for a live
authenticated provider or IDE session.

| Provider surface | Configuration / ownership | Discovery | MCP lifecycle | Agent-mediated | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | PASS | PASS | PASS | BLOCKED (`401`) | AFYX-294 isolated/native evidence plus disposable lifecycle regression; no new authentication |
| Codex IDE | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | No authorized IDE session |
| Antigravity/Gemini CLI global | PASS | PASS (`agy mcp list`) | PASS | BLOCKED (`429`) | AFYX-294 host evidence plus isolated ownership/read-back regression |
| Antigravity workspace / IDE | PASS (workspace fixture) | NOT_RUN (IDE) | PASS (fixture) | NOT_RUN | IDE UI and authenticated model execution unavailable |
| Claude Code CLI user/project | PASS (isolated fixture) | NOT_RUN (`runtimeVerified` remains false) | PASS (isolated lifecycle); NOT_RUN live | NOT_RUN | Native config semantics, scope precedence, identity mismatch and rollback tested without credentials |
| Claude skills / instructions | PASS (declared contract and scopes) | NOT_RUN live | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | User/project surfaces declared; no host-mediated load claim |
| Claude Code VS Code | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | Bundled extension CLI and IDE UI require separately authorized host acceptance |

TB6 source hardening requires batch preflight and bounded per-provider execution.
If a later provider fails, only exact captured Afyx configuration bytes may be
restored; any concurrent or foreign change makes recovery `INCOMPLETE` and must
remain preserved and visible. This is bounded compensation, not a claim of a
general distributed transaction or live provider acceptance.

TB7 source-stability checkpoint (2026-10-28): the published
`ProviderAdapter/v1`, `ProviderCapability/v1`,
`ProviderCapabilityNegotiation/v1`, `AfyxEngineeringTask/v1`, and
`AfyxEngineeringResult/v1` contracts are frozen for stable-v1 compatibility.
The compatibility regression locks provider order, provider-specific scopes,
side-effect-free fail-closed prevalidation diagnostics, and the TB6 recovery
envelope. It does not impose artificial feature parity or convert fixture
evidence into live-provider acceptance.

| Provider | Structural contract | Configuration / ownership | MCP lifecycle | Authenticated agent-mediated | IDE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | PASS (`ProviderAdapter/v1`, contract fixtures) | PASS (isolated/native evidence) | PASS (isolated/native evidence) | BLOCKED (`401`; authorization/session required) | `NOT_RUN` |
| Antigravity | PASS (`ProviderAdapter/v1`, contract fixtures) | PASS (isolated fixture) | PASS (isolated fixture) | BLOCKED (`429`; authorized provider/session required) | `NOT_RUN` |
| Claude Code | PASS (`ProviderAdapter/v1`, contract fixtures) | PASS (isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` fixture) | PASS (isolated fake-CLI fixture) | `NOT_RUN` (authenticated host not authorized) | `NOT_RUN` |

TB7 is therefore **SOURCE_READY** for the generalized three-provider platform,
not live-provider accepted and not T12 accepted. T12 still requires a signed,
installed Unified Kit candidate plus authorized capability-appropriate host
evidence; unavailable surfaces remain `BLOCKED` or `NOT_RUN`.

### Phase 8–11 critical path and parallel workstreams

| Workstream | Jira/evidence | Current state | Completion gate | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 Graph/Context Phase 8 | AFYX-8, AFYX-64 dogfood evidence | PARTIAL: two bounded cases, no general superiority claim | Representative public/private-safe workload matrix; correctness parity first; measured useful/non-useful cases; comparative claims only where controlled | Can run beside W2/W3; freeze scenarios before execution |
| W2 Expert acceptance | AFYX-283, AFYX-67/68 | ACCEPTANCE_PENDING | Independent D.6 verdict, Case A reference/tool bounds, controlled A1/B1 quality comparison, sanitized provenance | Independent evaluator/owner boundary |
| W3 Forge A0–A8 | AFYX-12, AFYX-88–96, AFYX-171–183 | A0–A3 contract complete; A4 implementation/candidate preparation complete with AFYX-92/178 `In Review`; A5 public harness preparation complete; formal `0/36 NOT_RUN` | Pending A4 acceptance where applicable, external prerequisites, formal campaign, A6/A7, explicit A8 decision | A8 blocks W4 |
| W4 Forge A9–A12 | AFYX-97–100, AFYX-184–188 | NOT_STARTED/BLOCKED | Selected implementation, adaptive modes, dogfood, stable contract | Only after A8 GO; NO-GO requires redesign/owner decision |
| W5 Platform Track B | AFYX-101–108; AFYX-53/56 and AFYX-294 as supporting evidence | PARTIAL: TB1–TB6 source candidate implemented; live provider/IDE acceptance and TB7 remain | TB0–TB7, AFYX-294 surface closure, and three-provider capability matrix | TB7 stable-platform acceptance follows reviewed TB6; may run beside Forge evaluation |
| W6 Phase 9 hardening | AFYX-58/59/62/63 and accepted CI/security/recovery evidence | SUBSTANTIAL REUSABLE EVIDENCE; final matrix pending | Only changed/untested release risks: installed exact artifact, corruption/interruption/rollback, resource bounds, 3OS packaging | After material component changes settle; focused reruns only |
| W7 T12 combined acceptance | AFYX-248/249/269/283/12 | BLOCKED by component gates | Contract below passes on exact installed candidate | W1, W2, W4, W5, W6 complete |
| W8 Phase 10 Private Beta | Existing Phase 10 program | NOT_STARTED | Controlled users/environments, upgrade/config stability, all release-blocking defects closed | Phase 8 + Phase 9 + T12 PASS |
| W9 Phase 11 Stable | Stable release gate | NOT_STARTED | Exact artifact/provenance, known limitations, no critical correctness/security blocker, owner release decision | Phase 10 exit PASS |

Safe parallelism: W1 dogfood scenario preparation, W2 evaluator handoff, W3
external authorization readiness, and W5 provider-core implementation may proceed
independently. Do not parallelize W4 before A8, provider adapters before TB1/TB2,
T12 before component freezes, or Private Beta before Phase 8/9/T12 PASS.

### T12 combined installed-product acceptance contract

T12 uses one future exact, signed **Unified Kit** candidate in disposable installed
environments. It is not the Graph-only Technical Alpha artifact path prepared by
PR #113. Source CI, Graph-only attestation, or component mocks cannot substitute
for the installed combined candidate; conversely T12 cannot rewrite or replace the
separate Graph-only provenance record. Acceptance requires:

1. **Identity/provenance:** Unified Kit source SHA/tree, workflow SHA, artifact
   ID/digest, component inventory, archive checksums, manifest, signer,
   version/channel, and installed identity agree. The PR #113 Graph-only ledger
   and prior artifact identities remain separate historical/checkpoint evidence.
2. **Five standalone smokes:** Graph, Context, Forge, Odoo Engineering, and Expert
   each start/use/stop independently with documented optional dependencies absent.
3. **Integrated engineering flow:** detect a representative repository, route the
   domain, index/query with Graph, optionally bound context with Context, apply the
   accepted Forge directive, execute focused validation, and emit sanitized evidence.
4. **Ownership/routing:** Odoo Engineering remains distinct; Expert selects only
   justified references; Forge does not take domain ownership; provider adapters do
   not rewrite user-owned or foreign configuration.
5. **Provider matrix:** Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, and Claude Code pass their actual
   supported capability contracts, with explicit unsupported/degraded outcomes.
6. **Failure/recovery:** missing optional component/provider, malformed config,
   interrupted process/update, corrupt local state, timeout, retry/idempotency,
   rollback, and cleanup preserve user data and isolate component failure.
7. **Bounds:** context/reference/tool/subprocess/time/memory/disk ceilings are
   declared before execution and measured where available; correctness cannot be
   traded for lower resource use.
8. **Cross-platform:** Windows, Linux, and macOS cover applicable source/package
   behavior. Hardware/provider/private-evaluator limitations remain explicit and
   cannot be converted into universal PASS.

T12 passes only with zero unknown correctness/security failure, zero unjustified
skip, no unclassified data-loss/ownership risk, and exact recovery evidence for
the selected failure scenarios. Nonblocking limitations must identify impact,
affected surface, workaround/degraded behavior, and owner acceptance.

### Prioritized backlog and first executable engineering slice

Priority order is:

1. **TB1/TB2 provider-core extraction (first implementation slice).**
2. Expert independent D.6 handoff/execution when the evaluator boundary exists.
3. Forge formal campaign authorization/execution; A8 decides whether A9–A12 exist
   in their current form.
4. Complete Phase 8 representative dogfood matrix in parallel with the independent
   evaluation lanes.
5. Implement Claude Code through the accepted adapter contract, then TB6/TB7.
6. Run only the residual Phase 9 matrix invalidated by changes, then T12, Phase 10,
   and Phase 11.

The first task is a code change, not another audit:

> **Extract the existing Codex and Antigravity implementations behind a versioned,
> provider-neutral `ProviderAdapter` contract without adding Claude yet.**

Scope: `scripts/components.json`, `scripts/afyx-provider-integration.mjs`, their
focused tests, and only directly necessary installer/control-plane call sites.
Acceptance criteria:

- Codex and Antigravity plan/apply/verify/uninstall outcomes and config ownership
  remain behaviorally unchanged;
- inspect/plan is side-effect free; apply is explicit, idempotent, bounded to
  Afyx-owned entries, and preserves foreign/user files;
- adapter capabilities and unsupported operations are explicit and deterministic;
- malformed/unknown provider or configuration fails closed with sanitized
  diagnostics and no partial persistent mutation;
- standalone component installation remains usable when provider integration is
  absent;
- focused positive, foreign-entry denial, malformed-config, rollback/idempotency,
  and cross-shell/control-plane regressions pass; exact-head 3OS CI is required
  because shared installer/provider paths are affected.

Rollback boundary: one concern-scoped PR to `dev`. Claude Code integration,
installed-runtime mutation, Forge execution, Alpha/Main promotion, artifact build,
publication, and release are explicitly out of scope.

This document is the forward-looking execution contract for Afyx Code
Engineering Kit. Historical closure evidence remains in
`AFYX_INDEPENDENCE_PLAN.md`; it is evidence, not authority for creating new
micro-phases after C07.11.

## Product direction

Afyx is a local-first **Engineering Intelligence & Assurance Platform** for
developers and AI coding agents.

Core objective:

> **Maximum engineering outcome with minimum agent effort.**

Afyx Graph objective:

> **Provide the smallest sufficient engineering context required to produce the
> highest-confidence correct result.**

Long-term product evolution:

```text
Code understanding
  -> repository understanding
  -> engineering-system understanding
```

The product is not defined by parser count, tool count, or test count. It is
defined by correctness, useful engineering context, bounded cost, reliable
automation, maintainable ownership, and evidence-backed claims.

### V1 optimization contract

Afyx v1 optimizes for **quality-adjusted resource efficiency**, not for the
smallest raw token count.

Canonical rule:

> **Use no less context, reasoning, tooling, or validation than required for the
> target quality, and no more than produces useful evidence.**

Therefore:

- correctness and precision are hard gates;
- token efficiency means eliminating irrelevant context, repeated discovery,
  duplicate reads, redundant tool calls, and redundant validation;
- Afyx must not starve an agent of context merely to reduce token usage;
- Afyx Graph should reduce the search space toward the **minimum sufficient
  engineering context**, especially for large repositories and workspaces;
- validation scope is proportional to the real impact/risk of a change;
- evidence that remains valid is reused rather than recomputed;
- after correctness is established, prefer the most direct, efficient, and
  performant Afyx-native implementation supported by measurement;
- v1 requires no arbitrary percentage claim against the historical baseline;
  comparative superiority claims require measured evidence.

The intended engineering loop is:

```text
task
  -> relevant graph / impact cone
  -> minimum sufficient context
  -> sufficient reasoning / tools
  -> scoped implementation
  -> minimum sufficient validation
  -> closure evidence
```

Optimization is successful only when resource waste decreases **without reducing
required output quality**.

## Canonical development method

All remaining independence work follows this sequence:

1. Understand observable behavior.
2. Specify the smallest required Afyx contract.
3. Analyze redundancy, coupling, complexity, context cost, memory cost, and tool-call cost.
4. Design the Afyx-native implementation.
5. Reimplement independently.
6. Modify and optimize for the actual Afyx requirement.
7. Replace the superseded implementation.
8. Perform minimum sufficient validation for the risk.
9. Erase historical residue in the touched scope.
10. Perform one final global audit at the appropriate roadmap boundary.

Canonical rule:

> **Behavior reference, not source template.**

Testing is a verification guardrail, not the objective of the task. Stronger
differential, mutation, performance, or provenance evidence is reserved for
genuinely high-risk boundaries such as parsing, extraction, resolution,
security, concurrency, persistence, data-loss risk, and release integrity.

### Phase 5F — Third-Party Source / Runtime Replacement

Status: **ACTIVE**

Task: `AFYX-91852`

#### 5F.1 — Inventory / Before-State

Status: **COMPLETE**

Checkpoint:

`bef1643f21d76182776a9528e4f3ab262785a737`

Contract items:

- classify shipped runtime.
- classify shipped libraries.
- classify shipped source.
- classify shipped assets.
- classify build-only and test-only dependencies.
- record parser/grammar ownership.
- record native-kernel ownership.

- Afyx-owned DOM / SVG / CSS runtime.
- existing typed adapter/wire/model boundaries preserved.

Result:

- UI production dependencies = 0.
- active Svelte source = 0.
- shipped viewer reduced to native product assets.

#### 5F.4 — Parser / Grammar Replacement

Status: **ACTIVE — NATIVE ROUTES COMPLETE; V1 CONTRACT DECISION / ERADICATION PENDING**

Current branch:

`afyx/native-phase5f-parser-grammar`

Latest verified implementation checkpoint:

`3e6b624505680e264af3b5f681be0f806a84648d`

Current native foundation:

- dependency-free bounded native scanner.
- UTF-16 source-position contract.
- strings/comments treated as opaque.
- bounded delimiter handling.
- malformed/incomplete source safety.
- no fake historical AST compatibility layer.
- native semantic Tree-sitter reachability = `0`.
- native active syntax parser reachability = `0`.
- named parser-backed native routes = `0`.
- parser-backed special-format semantic routes = `0`.

Completed native semantic migration includes the supported language and
special-format families established by the Phase 5F evidence ledger, including:

- TypeScript / TSX / JavaScript / JSX.
- Python / Go / Java.
- Rust / Kotlin / Scala.
- C / C++ / Objective-C / C#.
- Swift / ArkTS / Solidity.
- PHP / Ruby / Lua / Luau / R.
- Dart / Nix / Pascal / VB.NET.
- Erlang / Terraform / OpenTofu / COBOL.
- CFML / CFScript / CFQuery.
- Svelte / Vue / Astro embedded-script semantics.
- Razor / Blazor C# regions.

Completed production-contract closure boundaries:

- native semantic primitive closure.
- native resolution and conformance closure.
- native lexical receiver precision closure.
- frozen native extraction/framework-synthesis inventory closure.

Current verified gap metrics:

```text
route-level native semantic gaps:       0
lexical receiver/binding gaps:          0
frozen framework/extraction inventory: 15 -> 0
```

The former selected inventory result `22 -> 6` is **not** a global production
gap count. Six ranking/explore candidates remain in the frozen accounting, and
the broader campaign also exposed historical native differences outside that
selected inventory (for example RTK Query, Spring events, Vue store, and Java
anonymous-class behavior). Their v1 status must be decided by product value and
evidence rather than automatically reproduced.

Current physical/parser state after grammar and packaging closure:

```text
default parser fallback:           CLOSED
parser bootstrap:                  CLOSED
tracked grammar WASM:              0
shipped grammar WASM:              0
grammar staging/copy:              0
package-resolved grammar use:      0
SyntaxNode/parser coupling:        0
web-tree-sitter:                   0
tree-sitter-wasms:                 0
```

V1 contract decision gate:

**COMPLETE**

Decision checkpoint:

`3425348dcf4079bb35385a31a98ce54286ec9f0b`

The audit classified remaining behavioral differences into:

- `V1_REQUIRED`.
- `NATIVE_CORRECTION`.
- `LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_ONLY`.
- `POST_V1`.
- `ENVIRONMENT_OR_TOOLING_NOISE`.

Authoritative decision-gate accounting:

```text
TOTAL ASSESSED DIFFERENCE FAMILIES = 14
SEMANTIC / PRODUCT DIFFERENCES     = 11

V1_REQUIRED                       = 5 -> 0
NATIVE_CORRECTION                 = 1
LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_ONLY         = 1
POST_V1                           = 4
ENVIRONMENT_OR_TOOLING_NOISE      = 3
```

The five v1 blockers are:

1. correct real-index context selection / expansion / budgeting;
2. spend explore reservation on relevant source without exceeding the hard cap;
3. prevent source-line re-delivery across explore calls;
4. reject ordinary non-store `actions` members;
5. preserve Java abstract definitions and anonymous override relationships.

Non-blocking decisions:

- retain the native deprioritization correction;
- do not tune floating scores without measured product impact;
- defer Expo Router attribution, RTK Query completeness, Spring Event
  enrichment, and Vuex mutation recall to post-v1;
- keep environment/tooling noise separate from semantic implementation.

Implementation checkpoint:

`62621a0639f42db0eaac69ef087436d851cdba88`

Closure evidence:

- real-index context: `77/77 PASS`;
- qualifying explore allocation: `8/8 PASS`;
- cross-call source dedup: `27/27 PASS`;
- Vue-store positive/negative precision: `2/2 PASS`;
- Java abstract/anonymous contract: `1/1 PASS`;
- final native campaign: `5,622 PASS / 54 FAIL / 213 SKIP`, with zero
  remaining `V1_REQUIRED` or unknown product failures.

Decision:

```text
V1_SEMANTIC_CONTRACT = FROZEN
```

Completed implementation boundary:

> **Afyx V1 Required Behavior Closure**

This must be one consolidated closure of the five required behavior families,
not five independent micro-phases.

Semantic closure rule:

```text
five V1-required behavior families
  -> one consolidated implementation closure
  -> focused + risk-proportional validation
  -> V1_REQUIRED = 0
  -> semantic contract freeze
```

Completed measurement boundary:

> **Native Performance & Token Efficiency Baseline**

Authoritative state:

```text
NATIVE_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE = FROZEN
```

The same-fixture default/native campaign froze cold indexing, sync, graph/query,
context/explore information density, MCP/daemon lifecycle, persistence, RSS,
and artifact-footprint evidence beside correctness digests. Native peak RSS
(+49.63 MB on the controlled 301-file fixture) is the primary measured
optimization candidate; it does not block the trustworthy baseline. Provider
tokens and a large real-repository agent campaign remain explicitly unmeasured.

The exact next boundary is:

> **Native Kernel Closure**

The remaining parser/runtime closure sequence is:

```text
A. Native Performance & Token-Efficiency Baseline [COMPLETE]
   Establish representative OLD/native measurements and large-repo context
   efficiency evidence without requiring an arbitrary percentage claim.

B. Global Default Fallback Closure [COMPLETE]
   Make Afyx-native semantic/syntax/guard routing unconditional in production.
   The historical parser may remain only as an explicitly isolated oracle if
   still justified for a short transition.

C. Parser Bootstrap & Worker-Protocol Closure [COMPLETE]
   Remove parser initialization, grammar reads/transfers/load messages, and
   parser caches while preserving the native worker pool.

D. Parser Adapter & Tree-Walk Source Closure [COMPLETE]
   Remove TreeSitterExtractor, parser adapters, AST/tree-walk helpers/types, and
   obsolete parser-backed syntax/guard paths.

E. Grammar & Packaging Closure [COMPLETE]
   Remove tracked/shipped grammar WASM, grammar staging/copy requirements, and
   package-resolved grammar use.

F. Runtime & Dev/Test Isolation [COMPLETE]
   Remove production web-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-wasms requirements and delete
   or strictly isolate any remaining parser-only tooling/oracles.
```

Canonical routing state:

```text
GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FALLBACK = CLOSED
PARSER_BOOTSTRAP = CLOSED
PARSER_WORKER_PROTOCOL = CLOSED
PARSER_ADAPTER_AND_TREE_WALK_SOURCE = CLOSED
GRAMMAR_AND_PACKAGING = CLOSED
PARSER_RUNTIME_AND_DEV_TEST_ISOLATION = CLOSED
TRACKED_GRAMMAR_WASM = 0
SHIPPED_GRAMMAR_WASM = 0
WEB_TREE_SITTER = 0
TREE_SITTER_WASMS = 0
```

Performance/token principle:

> Afyx does not optimize by withholding resources required for quality. It
> optimizes by using graph/impact evidence to avoid irrelevant context, repeated
> discovery, unnecessary tool calls, and validation that cannot change the
> engineering decision.

Validation principle:

- local changes use focused positive/negative tests and the smallest affected
  regression set;
- shared semantic/core changes add representative cross-language/integration
  coverage;
- full production campaigns, packaging, and independence audits are reserved
  for architecture/release closure gates or when targeted evidence cannot
  resolve a real risk;
- every validation run must answer a specific unresolved risk;
- already-valid evidence is reused when the dependency/impact boundary proves it
  remains applicable.

Parser principle:

> Preserve or improve Afyx product meaning and quality, not historical parser
> implementation details.

No supported v1 language may be silently dropped to simplify independence.

#### 5F.5 — Native Kernel Closure

Status: **COMPLETE**

Contract items:

- classify remaining kernel product value after native parser completion.
- remove the optional kernel if it no longer provides justified product value,
  or independently reimplement the required product behavior.
- remove third-party native crates from the shipped product boundary.
- remove vendored/generated grammar source.
- remove optional third-party kernel runtime ownership.
- retain legal evidence until the underlying material and obligation are
  legitimately gone.

Exit:

> Shipped Afyx product has no third-party native-kernel ownership.

Closure state:

```text
KERNEL_VALUE = NONE
third-party kernel ownership = 0
third-party native crates = 0
vendored/generated grammar source = 0
kernel runtime dependency = 0
NATIVE_KERNEL_CLOSURE = CLOSED
```

#### 5F.6 — Runtime / Distribution Closure

Status: **COMPLETE**

Contract items:

- bundled Node runtime -> 0.
- shipped `node_modules` -> 0.
- no substitute bundled general-purpose runtime merely to move the dependency.
- define the final external runtime contract if an external platform runtime is
  required.
- launcher/runtime detection.
- clear minimum-version policy.
- supported-platform validation.
- final release artifact composition.

Exit:

> Afyx release artifact contains no bundled general-purpose third-party runtime
> or dependency tree under the agreed strict product boundary.

Closure state:

```text
Runtime = external Node.js >=22.5.0
bundled Node runtime = 0
shipped node_modules = 0
bundled general-purpose runtime = 0
RUNTIME_DISTRIBUTION_CLOSURE = CLOSED
```

#### 5F.7 — Final Phase 5F Artifact Audit

Status: **COMPLETE**

Required gates:

- product runtime dependency tree under strict scope: zero unwanted third-party runtime dependencies.
- bundled Node: zero.
- shipped `node_modules`: zero.
- tracked/shipped third-party parser grammar WASM: zero.
- third-party parser runtime: zero.
- vendored third-party grammar source: zero.
- shipped third-party UI runtime/assets: zero.
- shipped third-party native kernel: zero.
- new third-party product dependencies: zero.
- language semantic contract: PASS.
- core regression: PASS.
- release artifact audit: PASS.
- supported-platform CI: PASS.
- fresh product install from the release/distribution boundary: PASS.
- first-run launcher/runtime detection: PASS.
- real repository/workspace initialization and first index: PASS.
- search/context/callers/callees/impact/affected query flow on that initialized repository: PASS.
- MCP initialize and real query from the installed artifact: PASS.
- clean shutdown, restart, reopen existing index, incremental file change/sync, and re-query: PASS.
- product viability smoke has zero install/init/index/startup/reopen/incremental-sync crash, zero unhandled exception, zero silent empty result for known-positive queries, zero corrupt index, and zero UNKNOWN product failure.

Hard product-viability gate:

```text
AFYX_PRODUCT_INSTALL_SMOKE        = PASS
AFYX_REPO_INIT_SMOKE              = PASS
AFYX_REAL_END_TO_END_PRODUCT_SMOKE = PASS
```

These gates must execute from the actual built/release artifact in a fresh
temporary installation location with only the documented external runtime
prerequisites. Running solely from the development repository or its existing
`node_modules` is insufficient evidence.

Historical legal evidence may still remain until Phase 5H.

Closure evidence from canonical starting HEAD
`57b48cef89d42002e7acb30085b5d58c84923e1d`:

PHASE_5F                             = COMPLETE
```

Windows was measured locally. Linux and macOS remain statically validated for
this audit because no matching branch CI run existed; native execution is not
fabricated. The next boundary is Phase 5G. Technical Alpha remains inactive and
still requires Phase 5G, Phase 5H, and Phase 5I PASS.

### Phase 5G — Legacy Product Identity / Historical Artifact Eradication

Status: **COMPLETE**

Canonical starting HEAD: `f7f3294bdbb4150a3e037622feda9ad6e1a164d8`.

The inventory classified every literal identity family before editing. Active
source held 91 historical ticket labels and the shipped explore benchmark held
one; all 92 were replaced with behavior-owned terminology without changing
executable code. The remaining ledger is deliberately non-active:

- `HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE`: 144 textual references (143 regression/evidence
  ticket references and one truthful ancestry reference);
- `LEGAL_PROVENANCE`: three retained attribution/license files;
- `EXTERNAL_EXCEPTION`: one ignored local developer-index directory;
- `FALSE_POSITIVE`: 145 ephemeral `cg-*` test-directory prefixes plus five
  uses of the generic domain phrase “code graph”.

The `cg-*` prefixes are arbitrary test isolation names: they are not shipped,
runtime-reachable, user-visible, configuration, compatibility aliases, or
product identity. Current Afyx compatibility surfaces (public installer
exports, provider migration cleanup, schema migration, CLI contracts, and
daemon upgrade safety) remain because they have current V1 value; none is a
historical-product compatibility dependency.

The identity audit now enforces active surfaces while classifying the exact
historical/legal evidence paths and ignored external index instead of erasing
truthful evidence. Its focused suite passes 10/10. Static identity metadata,
the repository evaluator, clean TypeScript/UI production build, 21-check
CLI/MCP smoke, distribution verifier, npm-pack inventory, and a verified
1,367-entry Windows bundle all pass. Package and bundle scans found zero active
historical identity, historical config/path residue, or obsolete compatibility
payload.

Closure counts:

```text
ACTIVE_PRODUCT_IDENTITY        = 0
ACTIVE_RUNTIME_CONFIG          = 0
ACTIVE_PATH_OR_ENV             = 0
ACTIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_RESIDUE  = 0
OBSOLETE_COMPATIBILITY         = 0
TEST_ONLY_OBSOLETE             = 0
UNCLASSIFIED_RESIDUE           = 0
V1_REQUIRED failure            = 0
UNKNOWN product failure        = 0
PHASE_5G                       = COMPLETE
```

Phase 5F product-viability evidence remains valid because Phase 5G changed no
runtime behavior, dependency, parser, grammar, kernel, config, path, or public
contract. Technical Alpha remains inactive. Phase 5H is the exact next
boundary and is not started here.

Contract items:

- historical product identity in active product surfaces = 0.
- historical naming in active architecture/config/runtime = 0.
- old config/env/path ownership = 0.
- historical implementation residue = 0.
- obsolete compatibility residue removed unless explicitly justified.
- historical evidence documents remain truthful and are not rewritten to erase
  provenance.

Exit:

> Active Afyx product and architecture no longer depend on or present the
> historical product identity.

### Phase 5H — Historical License Closure

Status: **COMPLETE (2026-10-09)**

Starting HEAD: `81af1777297814ccc7603fd0552be496ef4209f3`

The legal/provenance ledger traced all three Phase 5G files to the previously
incorporated engine implementation:

| File | Historical coverage | Current/shipped corresponding material | Decision |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `afyx-graph/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | prior engine implementation attribution | 0 / 0 | `REMOVE_OBSOLETE` |
| `afyx-graph/LICENSES/THIRD_PARTY_ENGINE_MIT.txt` | prior engine implementation license | 0 / 0 | `REMOVE_OBSOLETE` |
| `afyx-graph/engine/LICENSE` | prior engine implementation license copied into npm package | 0 / 0 | retain path, replace with current Afyx MIT license identical to root `LICENSE` |

The notice-to-material trace ends at the Phase 5F removals: no covered source,
asset, runtime, binary, generated material, grammar, parser, native kernel, or
library remains in the tracked product or release artifacts. Git history and
the Phase 5 evidence sections retain the truthful historical record; historical
evidence is not an active release notice.

| Artifact | Current Afyx license | Third-party license | Third-party notice | Historical-only legal material | Unexplained legal material |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| npm pack (1,361 entries) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Windows archive | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Linux archive | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| staged release tree | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

`distribution-product.json`, both installers, the release workflow, bundle
builder, repository validator, and regression tests enforce a single root-level
current `LICENSE` and reject either obsolete historical legal filename.

Engine and UI production dependencies remain zero. Development tooling is not
bundled production material. Node.js >=22.5.0 is an externally supplied
platform runtime; no Node binary, source, or `node_modules` tree is
redistributed, so no Node notice is bundled. Prompt Master is fetched from its
separately managed upstream repository and is not shipped in Afyx Graph.
Headroom remains a detection-only external exception and is not shipped.

Validation: legal validator unit tests `18/18 PASS`; legacy identity audit,
repository validator, static evaluation validator, clean production/UI build,
21-check CLI/MCP smoke, distribution verifier, npm pack legal inventory,
Windows archive inventory, Linux archive inventory, and `git diff --check`
pass. Phase 5F product viability evidence remains valid because no runtime
behavior source changed.

```text
UNCLEAR_LEGAL_OBLIGATION                      = 0
unwanted third-party attribution requirement = 0
unwanted third-party release notice payload  = 0
unexplained shipped legal material           = 0
V1_REQUIRED failure                           = 0
LEGAL_CLOSURE_BLOCKER                         = 0
UNKNOWN product failure                       = 0
PHASE_5H                                      = COMPLETE
```

This is an engineering artifact/provenance determination, not broader legal
advice. It does not declare `AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT = TRUE`; Technical Alpha
remains inactive pending Phase 5I.

Contract items:

- historical attribution review.
- third-party notice review.
- grammar/license evidence review.
- release notice payload review.
- verify that material requiring retained attribution has actually been removed
  before deleting any notice.
- keep Prompt Master and Headroom explicit as separately managed external
  exceptions.

Exit:

> Release legal/attribution state matches the actual final technical artifact.

### Phase 5I — Final Independence Audit

Status: **COMPLETE (2026-10-10)**

Starting HEAD: `14c138024fef26cd303d9c0bcb16340830776652`.

The audit establishes the technical-ownership, historical-eradication, legal,
and release-composition assertions. Engine and UI production dependencies are
zero. The tracked production tree contains 371 files / 4,842,295 bytes and no
tracked WASM, native binary/library, vendor tree, historical license header, or
third-party runtime. Existing Phase 3/C01-C07 provenance campaigns plus the
Phase 5F-H replacement, identity, and notice-to-material evidence leave zero
unexplained retained private implementation or substantive upstream overlap.
Legacy identity, graph identity/legal, component, and static-evaluation
validators all pass.

The final release audit rebuilt and verified these artifacts:

| Artifact | Entries / files | Unpacked bytes | Artifact bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `dist` | 1,336 files | 9,002,544 | n/a | per-file manifest verified |
| npm pack | 1,361 files | 9,172,330 | 2,235,369 | `56f0c51dd5f6b4f3b71051f2ec93b754602fbc74e4206843e32bdc979cf7a28a` |
| Windows x64 archive | 1,365 entries / 1,340 files | 9,006,813 | 2,806,996 | `8e45a2b3b690dd09b1716330aec130ec3a4113f272ccd0cd4742d1aaea8f2d99` |
| Linux x64 archive | 1,366 entries / 1,340 files | 9,007,089 | 2,143,373 | `fc4f6b52b1f9729a049204632b0ab8a8ff7e22fff5e5464d0cbc403f2ae0bd1a` |

Each staged archive has one current Afyx `LICENSE`; no third-party notice or
license payload is present. Unwanted bundled source, assets, runtime,
`node_modules`, parser runtime/WASM, native kernel/library, and historical
identity counts are zero. The sole npm text scan match is the Afyx-owned
distribution verifier rejecting `web-tree-sitter`/`tree-sitter-wasms`, not a
bundled implementation. External Node.js >=22.5 remains a platform
prerequisite; Prompt Master and Headroom remain separately managed external
boundaries.

Three audit defects were corrected without broadening architecture: the
distribution test fixture now follows the one-license Phase 5H contract;
semantic score comparison preserves identities/order while accepting only
finite SQLite BM25 values across supported Node versions; and native extraction
restores Python inheritance, Python `self` calls, and Java field-type
references. The semantic comparator independently requires the correct Java
`testRender -> render` edge and `UpperFormatter` result before classifying them
as `NATIVE_CORRECTION`. Focused extractor/distribution tests pass 18/18, all six
semantic fixtures pass, CLI/MCP smoke passes 21/21, and clean production/UI
build plus artifact verification pass.

Technical Alpha is nevertheless blocked. Diagnostic Graph Build run
`37950282483` on the starting HEAD reported Linux 5,644 pass / 32 fail / 9
declared skips across 13 files. Eight failures were the corrected Phase 5H
distribution-fixture drift. The remaining 24 assertions across 12 files include
core extraction/resolution and UI/API behavior; they are not hidden as
environmental noise or normalized away. Windows and macOS reached the semantic
gate and failed only on the now-corrected raw-score portability issue, but a
final-head cross-platform run is still required after the audit commit.

Corrective continuation on 2026-10-10 grouped the 24 assertions by cause rather
than weakening them individually. The failure ledger closed as follows:

- native fact gaps: Go package variables/composite literals/conversions, Rust
  struct literals, TypeScript constructor and typed-return ownership, Java
  decorator stacks, C++ qualified receivers, and RTK Query endpoints/hooks;
- resolution/UI gaps: ArkTS `.ts` consumer through an `.ets` re-export barrel,
  response-chain status propagation, and Expo same-file screen attribution;
- invalid configuration acceptance: misspelled extension languages now fail the
  supported-language membership check;
- stale tests: native zero-config ranking, healthy C++ raw strings, and
  platform-normalized scan paths now assert the current independently verified
  contract instead of historical failure behavior.

The original 12-file regression group now has `1,070 PASS`, one declared skip,
and zero assertion failures. Windows-only temporary-directory cleanup can still
surface as `EPERM` after successful assertions and is not hidden as a product
pass. Additional regression isolation restored the TanStack `submit` attribution
while keeping Expo `via=[]`; TanStack `29/29` and Expo `69/69` pass. Clean
production/UI build, semantic `6/6`, CLI/MCP `21/21`, distribution verification,
identity/metadata validation, legacy-identity audit, and component contract pass.
The last five Linux assertions were isolated without repeating Phase 5F-H audits.
Environment leakage was disproved by unconditional production routing, matching
focused Node 24/26 behavior, and deterministic same-HEAD Linux reproduction.
Production HEAD `31ac39c394b5eb222117c2047e663f9ab1304a61` closed Go, Rust,
TypeScript-call, and C++ receiver defects. Final production HEAD
`54cc0786734be6c10fb9fe06d1316f0fa942e5f7` additionally rejects TypeScript
object-literal keys as function references and freezes the corrected qualified
Rust import expectation. The WAL concurrency assertion passed 5/5 in isolation,
so no unrelated WAL change was made.

Graph Build run [`38017609984`](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38017609984)
passes at `54cc0786734be6c10fb9fe06d1316f0fa942e5f7`: Linux unit tests,
semantic baseline, CLI/MCP smoke, and host-bundle smoke are green; Windows and
macOS build, semantic, and CLI/MCP jobs are green. The earlier runs
`37988190509` and `38015810450` remain the reproducible failure ledger rather
than being reclassified as environmental noise.

```

The next boundary is the separately authorized Technical Alpha activation
decision. This audit establishes readiness only; it does not activate Technical
Alpha and does not start Phase 6.

### AFYX-255 — Unified Technical Alpha lifecycle

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; Technical Alpha remains inactive**

AFYX-255 closes the installer/updater/verifier work package without changing
the Phase 5I independence result. The Windows and Linux/macOS entrypoints now
share a five-component state model and the prerequisite classes `REQUIRED`,
`COMPONENT_REQUIRED`, `BUILD_ONLY`, and `OPTIONAL`. Automatic update no longer
passes blanket force: Install/Update/Repair/Skip is selected from measured
state/version or an explicit deterministic component action.

Afyx Graph acquisition is release-first and validates checksum, product,
version, Technical Alpha channel, OS, and architecture. A missing or invalid
matching artifact falls back to a bounded clean build from a validated checkout;
Windows packages natively in PowerShell and does not require Bash. Staging,
ownership checks, backup/swap/rollback, and real CLI `--version`/`help`
verification protect an existing healthy runtime. Offline, no-fallback, dirty
source opt-in, validate-only, and dry-run behavior are explicit.

Local deterministic AFYX-255 evidence includes the focused lifecycle matrix,
component/metadata/legal validators, parser/shell syntax gates, no-mutation
dry-run, incompatible-Node refusal, unknown-owner refusal, and checksum-failure
preservation. Final-head Windows/Linux/macOS workflow results remain the
delivery evidence for AFYX-255 and the independent-install verification record
for AFYX-251; no public release or Technical Alpha activation is implied.

### AFYX-257 — Native parser reliability

Status: **DONE — IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED**

The reproduced JavaScript case is a 457,840-byte, single-line vendor bundle
with 181,296 native scanner tokens and 45,002 matched delimiter pairs. The
scanner itself completed in about 180 ms; V8 profiles isolated repeated
quadratic work in native fact extraction: delimiter-pair scans per semicolon
and member, whole-token export scans per declaration, typed-assertion pair
scans per call, and growing same-line prefix scans.

The bounded Afyx-native correction builds reusable nesting/semicolon indexes,
precomputes export and typed-assertion lookup data, and records same-line import
prefix state. Final-head Linux validation exposed that numeric delimiter depth
was not semantically equivalent when nested pairs shared an owner boundary.
The corrected index records the innermost containing pair and applies the
established strict interval rule for every language, retaining bounded lookup
without changing ArkTS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue/Pinia, Java, or downstream
context/UI semantics.
No parser runtime, grammar, timeout, dependency, fallback, or private source was
added. A generated one-line regression fixture covers nested initializers,
large class bodies, and invalid/incomplete input classification. Extraction
version 27 prompts existing projects to rebuild indexes that may have omitted
these files.

Read-only execution against the exact private SHA-256 case changed from no
result after 60 seconds to 1.86 seconds direct and 1.96 seconds through the real
parse worker, with identical direct/worker output counts: 1,686 nodes, 1,685
edges, 18,518 unresolved references, zero extraction errors. Private content and
paths are not stored in this repository.

Corrective validation after the Linux finding passed extraction `655/655`,
the eight affected downstream suites `214` with one skip, and the synthetic
long-line plus native-ArkTS guards `7/7`. TypeScript typecheck, clean
production/UI build, semantic baseline, and CLI/MCP smoke also passed locally.
Implementation-head CI `38063648783` and Afyx Graph Build `38063647999`
passed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. AFYX-257 is resolved; AFYX-258 remains
open for its explicitly deferred freshness/watcher UX scope.

### AFYX-260 — Exact-file Explore and retrieval correctness

Status: **DONE — IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED**

Baseline `386199301855091f6114eb5512386111ae4331a1`; implementation commit
`5b6fc45326474d59cada52be55054f315f349029`. The reproduced defect was limited
to explicitly named unsupported source: Explore resolved path spans only
against the indexed file catalog, so named PowerShell files were invisible and
installer vocabulary could rank an indexed TypeScript decoy instead.

The bounded correction preserves graph-backed retrieval for indexed files and
adds an Afyx-owned direct-source path for explicit `.ps1`, `.psm1`, and `.psd1`
targets only. Exact/basename ambiguity, missing files, project ignore policy,
lexical traversal, symlink escape, binary content, file count, walk count, and
source length are all enforced before rendering. Direct source is labeled as
non-graph evidence and never fabricates nodes, edges, calls, or semantic
certainty. Open-ended Explore remains graph-backed. CLI and MCP use the same
result path.

Synthetic evidence: before the fix, both CLI and MCP returned only
`src/lib/installer-decoy.ts` and reported no indexed match for
`scripts/install-afyx-graph.ps1`; after the fix, both returned the requested
`install.ps1` and `scripts/install-afyx-graph.ps1` source, returned no decoy,
and had identical normalized 43-line result text. Focused path-pinning passed
16 with one POSIX-only symlink check deferred to Linux CI; adjacent
retrieval/MCP tests passed 43; UI/browser tests passed 53 with three
platform skips; semantic baseline passed six fixtures; CLI/MCP smoke passed
21 checks; TypeScript typecheck and clean production/UI build passed.
Implementation/evidence-head CI `38075108668` and Afyx Graph Build
`38075110506` passed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Bounded Windows diagnosis found direct Node MCP startup already uses hidden
child processes and does not traverse the `.cmd` launcher. `ui --no-open`
does not launch a browser. The one relevant `cmd /c start` path was UI browser
auto-launch; it now passes `windowsHide: true`, with spawn-option and UI
lifecycle regression coverage. This is evidence of closing that source of
console creation, not a claim that every third-party console flash was
interactively reproduced.

AFYX-260 does not add PowerShell parsing, change extraction version 27, alter
MCP registration, or complete AFYX-205/AFYX-241. AFYX-248 remains in progress;
AFYX-258 and the remaining lifecycle/observability work remain separate.

### AFYX-258 — Prior extraction-diagnostics checkpoint

Status: **HISTORICAL PARTIAL CHECKPOINT — superseded by Batch 3 below**

The last full-index accounting now persists and is exposed by human and JSON
status output: visible files discovered, eligible/supported files, indexed,
symbol-empty skipped, unsupported, failed, and per-file retry outcomes. Index
completion state, pending references, and pending file changes remain separate
signals. Ignored paths are deliberately not enumerated and are reported as an
unknown count rather than silently conflated with skipped files.

Remaining AFYX-258 work includes broader Git `FRESH/STALE/UNKNOWN` UX, watcher
presentation, and any future opt-in ignored-path inventory. AFYX-251 and
AFYX-255 remain complete; AFYX-248 remains in progress. This batch does not
activate Technical Alpha, Phase 6, formal Alpha, or unrelated post-v1 work.

### Technical Alpha Batch 3 — AFYX-259 / AFYX-256 / AFYX-258

Status: **ACCEPTANCE GATES PASSED; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

AFYX-259 adds one revision-aware artifact identity across packaging and
installation. Product version, channel, target, source/build revision, checksum,
installed provenance, requested checkout revision, and extraction version are
kept distinct. Matching cache, stale same-semver cache, explicit unknown-revision
archive, fallback, rollback, and compiled extraction-version checks pass in
isolated lifecycle fixtures. Implementation commit:
`8e74ccdb526ddbe1a055ae3377e343e62ea3ab92`.

AFYX-256 integrates the installed runtime with Codex through native `codex mcp`
commands. It uses absolute Node plus installed JS entry point, preserves
unrelated configuration, skips conflicting/unproven ownership, supports an
explicit no-MCP path, backs up controlled changes, and verifies a real
initialize/tools-list handshake. Missing Codex remains nonfatal to a healthy
Graph runtime. Implementation commit:
`1701688d9872e195c12c2c80f75f385859f106b1`.

AFYX-258 now uses one read-only Index Health contract in CLI JSON/text, MCP, and
the viewer. Git freshness, filesystem/content pending state, extraction
completeness, extraction-version compatibility, pending references, watcher
state, and full-index accounting remain independent. A non-Git project reports
Git freshness `UNKNOWN` without implying extraction failure. Full indexing
persists bounded aggregate skip reasons (including `size_exceeded`), bounded
unsupported-extension evidence, completion timestamp, and measured scan,
parse/store, resolution/link, maintenance, and end-to-end durations. No status
surface rescans solely to obtain skip detail; `ignored` remains `null` / NOT
ENUMERATED. The six previously observed >1 MiB JavaScript skips remain accepted
guard behavior, not extraction failures.

Batch 3 does not enumerate ignored paths, increase the 1 MiB guard, modify
ranking/search semantics, or reactivate formal Odoo/IJP indexing. AFYX-248
remains in progress and Technical Alpha is not activated until mandatory
integrated and cross-platform gates pass.

Final CI closure: AFYX-259 (`8e74ccd`), AFYX-256 (`1701688`), and AFYX-258
(`1656a08`) were validated together after the bounded CI correction
`d0bf81f52186798d82a95caf63ca2a761d809087`. The correction retained the
disabled unrelated MCP-server fixture without embedding an audited legacy
identity token, and made Graph `--validate-only` tolerate an absent runtime
metadata file without creating installation roots. Required focused identity,
component, MCP integration, artifact identity, and lifecycle tests passed.
Final correction-head [CI run 38079830273](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38079830273)
and [Afyx Graph Build run 38079831486](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38079831486)
both passed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This closes the Batch 3 acceptance
evidence for AFYX-259, AFYX-256, and AFYX-258; it does not close AFYX-248 or
activate Technical Alpha.

### Technical Alpha Batch 4A — AFYX-263

Status: **ACCEPTANCE GATES PASSED; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

AFYX-263 menutup residual lifecycle dan supply-chain yang terverifikasi setelah Batch 3. Skill lifecycle sekarang memakai marker ownership dan content digest, canonical containment/reparse guard, transaksi stage/backup/swap/verify/rollback, recovery path untuk swap yang terputus, serta backup di `~/.afyx/backups` dengan batas yang gagal aman tanpa menghapus riwayat. Modified, foreign, malformed, dan unsafe targets dipertahankan secara default dan uninstaller menolaknya.

Prompt Master tetap upstream-owned pada tier yang sama dan kini diambil reproducibly dari commit `2bd92518e26bf659e21e3d9ab90573fcf3ddeccb`; staged `HEAD`, remote, manifest skill, dan clean state diverifikasi sebelum promosi. Release trust kini membedakan checksum integrity, commit-bound release manifest, publisher authenticity, dan build provenance. GitHub release workflow menghasilkan `RELEASE-MANIFEST.json`, menargetkan commit workflow eksplisit, dan menerbitkan GitHub artifact attestations; installer tidak lagi menyebut checksum sebagai authentication.

Final implementation checkpoint `ed40278e80c6bc644de70ae2ed10b3eb30e2d18e`: lifecycle baseline 8/8 PASS; ownership/fault-injection 6/6 PASS; artifact identity/provenance 4/4 PASS; component contract 8/8 PASS (1 host-only skip); MCP integration 4/4 PASS; project detection 14/14 PASS; doctor 10/10 PASS; component/identity/legacy validators PASS; Index Health 3/3 PASS; semantic baseline 6/6 PASS; CLI/MCP smoke 21/21 PASS; clean production/UI build PASS. [CI run 38083699363](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38083699363) dan [Afyx Graph Build run 38083702037](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38083702037) keduanya PASS pada Windows, Linux, dan macOS. macOS menjalankan lifecycle Bash pada system Bash 3.2; Windows menjalankan jalur PowerShell yang didukung workflow. AFYX-263 memenuhi acceptance Batch 4A; ini tidak mengaktifkan Technical Alpha dan tidak menutup AFYX-248.

### Technical Alpha Batch 4B — AFYX-264

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; FINAL-HEAD CI PENDING; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

AFYX-264 menambahkan adoption opt-in untuk instalasi Efficient Coding 1.1.0, Odoo Engineering 1.1.0, dan Prompt Master 1.8.0 yang berasal dari era sebelum `.afyx-install.json`. Dua skill Afyx harus cocok dengan digest distribusi historis pada baseline `b0b4d88eb7c42627598de71d6b0bf26317b9a694`. Prompt Master tidak dipercaya berdasarkan version saja: adoption memerlukan origin resmi, checkout bersih, dan HEAD tepat `2bd92518e26bf659e21e3d9ab90573fcf3ddeccb`. Classification `MODIFIED`, `FOREIGN`, atau `UNKNOWN` ditolak.

Action `component=adopt` memverifikasi provenance, containment, path safety, membuat dan memverifikasi backup durable, lalu hanya menambahkan ownership marker; isi skill tidak diganti atau di-upgrade. Dry-run tidak bermutasi dan repeated adoption idempotent. Implementasi migration tersedia, tetapi tidak ada adoption yang dijalankan terhadap instalasi user selama development.

Evidence lokal: focused adoption 4/4 PASS; lifecycle security 6/6 PASS; lifecycle contract 8/8 PASS; component contract 8/8 PASS dengan satu cross-shell host-only skip; PowerShell/Bash syntax PASS; component, identity/legal, dan legacy-independence validators PASS. Final-head cross-platform CI tetap diperlukan sebelum AFYX-264 dipindah ke Done.

### Technical Alpha Batch 4B.1 — AFYX-261

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; ACCEPTANCE REQUIRES FINAL-HEAD CI; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

Efficient Coding 1.2.0 mempertahankan correctness-first dan progressive disclosure sambil menambahkan loop `GROUND → LOCATE → REPRODUCE → CHANGE → VALIDATE → REPORT`, reliable bug baseline, cost lens kondisional, approval boundary eksplisit, serta pelaporan proporsional. Direct inspection tetap default untuk target sederhana; Afyx Graph hanya untuk relasi struktural yang material; saat Graph tidak tersedia fallback adalah direct-source search dan CodeGraph dilarang. Headroom tetap selektif dan exact original evidence harus tersedia.

Matriks sintetis enam skenario yang sama memberi baseline 1.1.0 `2/6 FULL` dan kandidat 1.2.0 `6/6 FULL`: known-file grounding, unknown-defect reproduction/stopping, cross-module Graph routing, unavailable-Graph fallback, authorization boundary, dan proportional reporting/noisy evidence. Ini bukti kontrak deterministik, bukan model-quality atau token-savings benchmark; tidak ada klaim penghematan token tanpa pengukuran. Usulan rigid three-search limit, mandatory six-line report, dan major-version 2.0.0 ditolak.

Adoption provenance 1.1.0 tetap dibekukan pada digest historis AFYX-264 dan kini diuji memakai fixture historis terpisah; instalasi pengguna tidak dimutasi. Acceptance memerlukan focused matrix, routing/component/doctor/adoption regressions, validators, dan final-head CI lintas platform.

Evidence lokal: refinement matrix 3/3 PASS (`2/6 → 6/6 FULL`); routing intent 20/20 PASS; routing mutation guard 11/11 PASS; component 8/8 PASS dengan satu host-only cross-shell skip; doctor 10/10 PASS; legacy adoption 4/4 PASS; component, graph identity, dan independence validators PASS; Python syntax dan `git diff --check` PASS. Corpus empat dokumen bertambah dari 751 menjadi 956 kata untuk kontrak baru; provider token usage dan outcome model tidak diukur, sehingga tidak ada klaim penghematan token atau superioritas model.

### Technical Alpha Batch 4B.2 — AFYX-262

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; ACCEPTANCE REQUIRES FINAL-HEAD CI; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

Odoo Engineering 1.2.0 mempertahankan version isolation dan sebelas reference Odoo 10–20 tanpa blanket rewrite. Refinement menambahkan corroboration dua supporting signal independen ketika strong version evidence tidak tersedia, unresolved handling untuk konflik, pemeriksaan override/`super`, multi-record/batching/prefetch/N+1, serta batas eksplisit group implication dan `sudo`. Pertanyaan penjelasan sederhana tetap ringan. Kontrak XML inheritance, persisted identifier, Odoo 20 exact-evidence safeguard, dan source/target migration isolation yang sudah benar dipertahankan.

Matriks sintetis enam skenario yang sama memberi baseline 1.1.0 `3/6 FULL` dan kandidat 1.2.0 `6/6 FULL`: Odoo 10 legacy compatibility, Odoo 17 multi-record ORM, Odoo 19 security, Odoo 20 exact evidence, conflicting migration evidence, serta XML/authorization negative behavior. Ini evaluasi kontrak instruksi deterministik, bukan eksekusi Odoo, model-quality benchmark, atau klaim token savings. Major version 2.0.0 dan rewrite sebelas version references ditolak karena tidak dibenarkan oleh perubahan semantik.

Provenance adoption 1.1.0 tetap dibekukan pada digest AFYX-264 melalui fixture historis terpisah; instalasi user, CODEX_HOME, MCP, database, dan IJP tidak disentuh. Synthetic skill evaluation tidak menyelesaikan formal Technical Alpha/IJP testing.

Evidence lokal: refinement matrix 3/3 PASS (`3/6 → 6/6 FULL`); routing guard 11/11 PASS; component contract 8/8 PASS dengan satu host-only cross-shell skip; doctor 10/10 PASS; legacy adoption 4/4 PASS; historical fixture 15/15 blob MATCH; component, graph identity/legal, dan legacy-independence validators PASS; Python syntax dan `git diff --check` PASS. Provider token usage dan outcome model tidak diukur, sehingga tidak ada klaim token savings atau superioritas model.

### AFYX-265 — Windows Git subprocess console closure

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; FINAL-HEAD CI PASS; DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION PENDING; AFYX-248 remains IN PROGRESS**

Baseline `61f041b15cdb2d6f4c29e8eeba4a9ea01f6f1d0f`. Three production
`execFileSync('git', ...)` sites that still used the default
`windowsHide: false` now set `windowsHide: true`:
`readGitExcludeExtraPatterns()`, `listGitIgnoredDirectories()`, and
`gitUserName()`. Arguments, cwd, stdio, timeout, maxBuffer, result handling,
and fallback behavior are unchanged; no caching or lifecycle refactor was made.

The Windows `mcp-initialize.test.ts` teardown previously requested `SIGKILL`
and immediately removed the child's temporary cwd. Because `child.kill()` does
not wait for process handles to close, all assertions could finish before
cleanup failed with `EPERM`. Teardown now awaits the child `close` event before
`rmSync`, without delay or failure suppression. Focused extraction/ignore/Trails,
MCP initialize and catch-up, negative Git cases, TypeScript typecheck,
production/UI build, and the 19-call production Git console-visibility audit
pass on the source candidate. Windows visible-window observation recorded no
visible or foreground console window during repeated ignore/scope Git paths.
The installed runtime and active MCP configuration remain unchanged.

Implementation commit `940b772a6be6e8dac09397726f27da7130382f02` passed
[CI run 38127465410](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38127465410)
on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Controlled deployment and actual installed Codex
MCP Windows validation remain required. AFYX-265 must not move to Done until
those deployment gates pass.

Required audits:

- native implementation audit.
- legacy identity/artifact eradication audit.
- zero-unwanted-third-party-license audit under the agreed strict product scope.
- release artifact audit.
- functional regression audit.
- supported-platform build audit.

Minimum final assertions:

- historical runtime dependency = 0.
- historical build dependency = 0.
- historical operational dependency = 0.
- historical implementation retained = 0.
- historical active product identity = 0.
- unexplained historical artifact = 0.
- unwanted third-party bundled source = 0.
- unwanted third-party bundled assets = 0.
- unwanted third-party bundled runtime = 0.
- unwanted third-party attribution requirement = 0.
- unwanted third-party release notice payload = 0.

Exit:

> **AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT = TRUE**

No earlier Phase 5 subphase may make this final claim.

## V1 Maturity / Test Milestones

These milestones define when Afyx may move from internal engineering into
progressively broader real-use testing. They do not replace the numbered phases;
they are release-maturity gates layered on top of them.

```

### Technical Alpha

Entry gate:

- Phase 5F product viability and final artifact audit: PASS.
- Phase 5G identity/artifact eradication: PASS.
- Phase 5H license closure: PASS.
- Phase 5I final independence audit: PASS.
- `AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT = TRUE`.
- install -> first run -> init real workspace -> index -> query -> MCP ->
  restart/reopen -> incremental sync has proven PASS from the actual product
  artifact.

Purpose:

- daily internal use by the developer on real projects.
- discover product-flow, installer, init/index, runtime, persistence, MCP, and
  workflow defects as early as possible.
- bugs and rough ergonomics are expected; release stability is not yet claimed.

### Alpha

Entry gate:

- Technical Alpha has no unresolved blocker preventing normal daily use.
- Phase 6 Unified Kit & Provider Control Plane: PASS.
- Phase 7 Engineering Assurance: PASS.
- installer/update/verify lifecycle and evidence-based engineering safeguards are
  usable enough for repeated real work.

Purpose:

- sustained real-project use by the developer and selected technical testers.
- validate daily workflow, lifecycle/control-plane behavior, diagnostics, and
  assurance before broader beta exposure.
- product may still contain known non-release-blocking defects.

### Private Beta

Readiness gate:

- Alpha evidence is sufficient to continue.
- Phase 8 real-world dogfood/comparative proof: PASS.
- Phase 9 product hardening/release engineering: PASS.
- no unresolved release-blocking install/init/runtime/data-integrity defect.

Execution:

- Phase 10 is the canonical Private Beta phase.
- use controlled private users and real environments.
- stabilize installer/runtime/configuration/upgrade behavior and triage
  release-blocking defects.

### Stable v1

Entry gate:

- Phase 10 Private Beta exit criteria: PASS.
- all Phase 11 stable-release gates: PASS.
- no unresolved critical correctness/security or release-blocking defect.

Release:

> **Afyx Code Engineering Kit v1.0.0 — Stable**

## Phase 6 — Unified Kit & Provider Control Plane

Status: **CORE IMPLEMENTED / ACCEPTED CI EVIDENCE REUSED / TRACK B GENERALIZATION PENDING**

Implementation evidence and the exact achieved-versus-pending matrix are maintained
in [AFYX_PHASE6_UNIFIED_CONTROL_PLANE.md](AFYX_PHASE6_UNIFIED_CONTROL_PLANE.md).
The control plane extends the existing component lifecycle; it does not create a
second installer, claim Alpha activation, or authorize production Forge.

Contract items:

- immutable component plan.
- desired state vs actual state.
- provider / agent adapter registry.
- Minimal / Recommended / Full / Custom presets.
- drift detection.
- repair.
- ownership classification: AFYX / EXTERNAL / USER.
- installer / update / verify convergence.
- provider capability representation.

v1 provider policy:

> Codex remains the primary provider target for v1.

Exit:

> Afyx can reason consistently about desired installation/runtime state and
> repair drift without destructive user-config ownership.

## Phase 7 — Engineering Assurance

Status: **IMPLEMENTED FOUNDATION / EXPANDED-v1 APPLICATION ACTIVE**

Contract items:

- Task Contract.
- Baseline Guard.
- Scope Guard.
- Ground Truth.
- risk-based regression selection.
- Mutation Proof when justified.
- Differential Proof when justified.
- Performance Gate.
- adaptive validation budget based on actual impact/risk.
- evidence reuse when prior evidence remains valid.
- failed-test classification.
- skipped-test classification.
- CI Evidence.
- Documentation Evidence.
- Merge Readiness.

Canonical assurance state:

```text
PLANNED
  -> ANALYZED
  -> IMPLEMENTED
  -> VALIDATED
  -> DOCUMENTED
  -> MERGE_READY
```

Exit:

> Engineering completion is evidence-based rather than inferred from code
> modification alone.

Release maturity:

> Completion of Phase 6 and Phase 7, with Technical Alpha free of blocking
> daily-use defects, opens the **Alpha** testing milestone.

Assurance rules:

```text
UNKNOWN FAILED TEST = 0
V1_REQUIRED correctness failure = 0
UNJUSTIFIED SKIP = 0
TEMPORARY SKIP = 0 before stable release
```

Expected platform/mode/optional-integration skips are allowed only when
explicitly classified and documented.

Validation levels:

```text
LEVEL 1 — local change
  focused contract + negative precision + relevant static/type check

LEVEL 2 — shared/core change
  Level 1 + affected regression + representative integration/build

LEVEL 3 — architecture/release closure
  full campaign + product surfaces + packaging + independence/release evidence
```

A broader level is used only when the smaller level cannot resolve the actual
risk.

## Phase 8 — Real-World Dogfood & Comparative Proof

Status: **PARTIAL — BOUNDED DOGFOOD COMPLETE; REPRESENTATIVE MATRIX PENDING**

Contract items:

- real Odoo work.
- real engineering repositories.
- small, medium, large, and multi-module/workspace-scale repositories.
- correctness and output-quality measurement.
- context usefulness.
- files/symbols retrieved or inspected.
- irrelevant-context and duplicate-read evidence where measurable.
- tool-call count.
- validation work executed.
- latency.
- context/token volume.
- repeatable controlled tasks.
- same task/model/repository conditions where comparison is claimed.

Comparative campaign:

- CONTROL — no structural graph tool.
- BASELINE — frozen historical structural-graph implementation.
- TREATMENT — Afyx Graph.

Principle:

> Correctness and required output quality are hard gates; token efficiency comes
> from eliminating waste, not starving the agent.

Claims policy:

> Do not claim measured superiority until this controlled campaign produces the
> evidence.

Exit:

> Afyx has real-world proof of where Graph helps, where it does not, and how much
> cost/correctness difference is actually measured.

## Phase 9 — Product Hardening & Release Engineering

Status: **ACCEPTANCE_PENDING — SUBSTANTIAL SECURITY/RECOVERY/RESOURCE EVIDENCE REUSABLE**

Contract items:

- crash recovery.
- corrupt/incomplete state recovery.
- disk-full handling.
- stale lock cleanup.
- daemon recovery.
- interrupted installer recovery.
- interrupted update recovery.
- rollback.
- checksum/signature policy.
- safe package validation.
- Windows validation.
- Linux validation.
- macOS validation.
- upgrade compatibility.
- failure diagnostics.
- release artifact smoke validation.

Exit:

> Afyx fails safely and predictably under realistic operational failure modes.

Release maturity:

> Completion of Phase 8 and Phase 9 opens **Private Beta readiness**. Phase 10
> is the canonical execution phase for that Private Beta.

## Phase 10 — Afyx v0.1 / Private Beta

Status: **PLANNED**

Contract items:

- controlled private users.
- installer/runtime feedback.
- workflow ergonomics.
- diagnostics feedback.
- configuration stabilization.
- upgrade-contract stabilization.
- release-blocking defect triage.
- real-environment compatibility feedback.

Exit:

> Private beta has produced sufficient evidence to freeze the stable v1
> behavioral and upgrade contract.

## Phase 11 — Stable Afyx v1.0

Status: **TARGET**

Required gates:

- `AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT = TRUE`.
- stable installer / update / uninstall.
- stable Afyx Graph runtime.
- stable Codex integration.
- stable project-state / migration policy.
- stable MCP contract.
- stable CLI contract.
- usable diagnostics and recovery path.
- representative dogfood PASS.
- supported-platform CI PASS.
- packaged artifact smoke PASS.
- known limitations documented.
- all remaining failed tests classified; unknown and v1-required correctness failures = 0.
- all skipped tests classified; unjustified/temporary skips = 0.
- minimum-sufficient context/validation behavior demonstrated on representative repositories.
- performance/token-efficiency evidence documented without unsupported percentage claims.
- no critical correctness/security issue open.

Release:

> **Afyx Code Engineering Kit v1.0.0 — Stable**

Do not publish stable v1 merely because development package metadata already
contains `1.0.0`.

# Final independence contract

Phase 5 may be classified complete only when every Phase 5I gate passes.

Prompt Master and Headroom are the only explicitly allowed final external
exceptions in this contract and remain separately managed. They must never be
silently reclassified as Afyx-owned source.

Phase 5F performs technical replacement. Phase 5H performs attribution/license
closure. Legal notices may be removed only after the underlying code, assets,
runtime, and obligations are legitimately gone.

# V1 release contract

Phase 11 is reached only after:

1. Phase 5 independence is complete.
2. Phase 6 lifecycle/control-plane behavior is stable.
3. Phase 7 assurance is usable.
4. Phase 8 real-world dogfood/comparative evidence is sufficient for public
   product claims.
5. Phase 9 hardening passes supported-platform release gates.
6. Phase 10 private beta produces no unresolved release-blocking defect.
7. Forge A12, Platform Track B TB7, Expert comparative acceptance, and T12
   combined installed-product acceptance pass.
8. no critical correctness/security issue remains open.

Version / maturity path:

```text
internal development
  -> Technical Alpha   (after Phase 5I)
  -> Alpha             (after Phase 6 + Phase 7)
  -> Private Beta      (Phase 10, after Phase 8 + Phase 9)
  -> stabilization / release candidate
  -> v1.0.0 Stable     (Phase 11)
```

# Expansion tracks and v1 inclusion override

Status: **TRACK A AND TRACK B REQUIRED FOR v1 BY 2026-10-27 OWNER DECISION;
TRACK C AND TRACK D REMAIN POST-v1**

The canonical track identities/order remain:

```text
TRACK A — AFYX FORGE
TRACK B — PLATFORM GENERALIZATION
TRACK C — ENGINEERING INTELLIGENCE EXPANSION
TRACK D — AFYX NATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
```

Tracks are ordered by the canonical product-development contract above. Track
letters must not be reassigned. Work may still be prioritized by measured value
once dependencies permit.

The optimization sequence is intentionally two-generation:

```text
Generation 1 — Independence
  behavior harvest
  -> independent Afyx-native reimplementation
  -> stable v1 product

Generation 2 — Native optimization
  mature Afyx-native workloads
  -> profile / measure
  -> evidence-driven redesign
  -> optimized Afyx-native engine
```

Track D does not postpone obvious optimization until post-v1. V1 must still fix
clear waste, pathological complexity, correctness-affecting inefficiency,
duplicate context, unnecessary I/O, and material regressions when evidence
justifies the change. Track D is the later deep systematic optimization program
that operates after Forge, provider generalization, and broader intelligence
support have created a more representative production workload.

## Track A — Afyx Forge

Scheduling note (2026-10-15): Track A is now permitted to proceed during the
current Alpha development cycle under the reviewable contract in
[`AFYX_ALPHA_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md`](AFYX_ALPHA_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md).
The 2026-10-27 owner decision supersedes the earlier scheduling-only exclusion:
Forge retains A0-A12 and is now a v1 requirement. It still cannot by itself
close Technical Alpha, Alpha, Private Beta, or Stable, and A8 remains an
evidence-driven GO/NO-GO boundary.

Afyx Forge was originally scheduled post-v1. That historical scheduling record
is preserved; current stable-v1 readiness now requires the applicable A0-A12
contract or an explicit owner scope decision following a defensible A8 NO-GO.

Goal:

> Convert the proven v1 engineering workflow into an adaptive Afyx-native
> directive system that allocates the minimum sufficient context, reasoning,
> tooling, and validation needed for the target quality.

Principle:

> Behavior reference, not source template. Architecture is chosen from
> benchmark evidence rather than pre-frozen around an existing prompt/skill.

Canonical phases:

- **A0 — Evaluation Freeze**
  - freeze benchmark tasks, scoring, and evidence format.
- **A1 — Capability Harvest**
  - harvest useful behavior from Efficient Coding, the independent master
    prompt, actual v1 workflows, and other legitimate behavioral references.
- **A2 — Capability Matrix**
  - map overlap, unique capabilities, cost, quality contribution, and failure
    modes.
- **A3 — Deduplication / Refinement**
  - remove redundant instructions and preserve only behavior with demonstrated
    value.
- **A4 — Candidate Construction**
  - B0: no directive.
  - B1: Efficient Coding 1.2.0.
  - B2: independent master prompt.
  - B3: Efficient Coding + independent master prompt.
  - B4: refined convergence candidate.
  - B5: Afyx Forge native candidate.
- **A5 — Benchmark Harness**
  - run controlled, repeatable engineering tasks with quality/resource evidence.
- **A6 — Quality Gate**
  - correctness and engineering quality first.
- **A7 — Efficiency Gate**
  - context, reasoning, token, tool, and validation efficiency after quality.
- **A8 — Data-Driven Architecture Decision**
  - choose the Forge architecture from evidence.
- **A9 — Forge Implementation**
  - implement only if A8 supports it.
- **A10 — Adaptive Engineering Directive**
  - dynamically allocate context/reasoning/tool/validation budgets by task risk
    and evidence.
- **A11 — Dogfood & Optimization**
  - use real engineering work and optimize measured bottlenecks.
- **A12 — Stable**
  - freeze the stable Forge contract.

Odoo Engineering remains a separate domain skill and is not folded into Forge
merely to reduce component count.

### T08 closure — A0-A3 contract foundation

T08 freezes the Forge evaluation method and decision rules without executing
the B0-B5 campaign or selecting an implementation architecture. The canonical
contract is [`AFYX_FORGE_A0_A3_CONTRACT.md`](AFYX_FORGE_A0_A3_CONTRACT.md),
with machine-readable identities in
[`AFYX_FORGE_A0_A3_BASELINE.json`](AFYX_FORGE_A0_A3_BASELINE.json).

Efficient Coding 1.2.0 has a verified repository identity and deterministic
contract evidence. Historical Prompt Master evidence is limited to one
identity-bound prompt-authoring smoke and is not treated as the Independent
Master Prompt or as general engineering-quality evidence. The Independent
Master Prompt itself has no authorized bytes, provenance, or digest in the
canonical repository, so B2/B3 construction remains blocked. B4/B5 have not
been constructed.

The six-category by six-candidate discovery stratum is frozen at 36 cells.
It is a separate Forge campaign rather than an extension of the Expert
27-run ceiling, but the Forge budget is not approved. Exact campaign runtime
identity and independently enforced evaluator isolation also remain blockers.
T08 is complete at the contract layer; T09 may prepare A4-A8 only after its
recorded input, identity, isolation, and budget prerequisites are satisfied.
No A8 GO, performance improvement, final Forge engine, or v1 release-scope
change is implied.

### T09.P0 closure — benchmark readiness and candidate identities

Status: **PREPARATION COMPLETE / BENCHMARK EXECUTION BLOCKED**.

The canonical readiness record is
[`AFYX_FORGE_T09_P0_READINESS.md`](AFYX_FORGE_T09_P0_READINESS.md), with
the executable public preparation under `evals/forge/`. B0 and B1 have
verified configurations; B5 has an independent evaluation-only directive
derived from the A3 contract. B2 has no authorized executable artifact,
therefore B3 remains blocked and B4 is not constructed. None of these states
is a production Forge architecture decision.

Six public synthetic scenarios cover the frozen categories. Their pristine
baseline behavior, path containment, content hashes, deterministic 36-cell
order, negative B2 substitution, and candidate tamper detection are validated
without a model call. The proposed campaign runtime is not owner-approved,
Forge-specific evaluator isolation was not independently executed, the
evaluator-only bundle is not frozen, and the 36-cell budget is not approved.
T09 benchmark execution and A8 therefore remain blocked. The frozen v1 release
requirements, Expert evidence, Graph behavior, and Alpha environment are
unchanged.

### T09.P1 checkpoint — external gates blocked

T09.P1 reverified the P0 identities and six-scenario/36-cell ordering, then added
deterministic materialization checks for B0, B1, and B5. A machine-readable
campaign gate now exits nonzero while any prerequisite remains unresolved, so a
passing public readiness validation cannot be mistaken for campaign authority.

No authorized B2 source, independent evaluator environment, private-bundle
manifest, or owner approval was supplied. B3/B4 and the complete candidate
matrix remain unfrozen; campaign/source/environment/evaluator identities remain
unset. Status is **PREPARATION COMPLETE / EXTERNAL GATES BLOCKED**. A8 has no GO
decision and no model cell was executed.

### T09.P2A checkpoint — Route B candidate matrix complete

Owner authorization dated 2026-10-16 created controlled amendment
`A0-ROUTE-B-2026-10-16`. Historical original B2 remains unresolved and was
not relabeled. New Afyx-owned B2 0.1.0, ordered B3 (`B1` then `B2`), and
refined B4 0.1.0 now have canonical identities and deterministic disposable
materialization. All six slots are prepared but unexecuted. Runtime, isolation,
independent evaluator, evaluator-only bundle, 36-cell and confirmation budgets,
and final execution authorization remain blocked. No benchmark, A8 decision,
product implementation, Prompt Master removal, or release-scope change occurred.

### T09.E1.5 checkpoint — public secure handoff prepared

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E1_SECURE_HANDOFF.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E1_SECURE_HANDOFF.md)
defines developer/evaluator/evaluated-agent boundaries, Windows-only per-cell
lifecycle, sanitized public schemas, fail-closed isolation checks, cleanup, and
owner handoff. The manifest fingerprints this public contract; B0-B5 identities,
fixture, 36-cell order, budgets, and authorization state are unchanged. WSL and
the owner's personal Ubuntu are excluded from formal execution. Status remains
**CAMPAIGN BLOCKED** pending all seven external gates.

### T09.E5 checkpoint — WSL formal-runtime amendment proposed

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E5_WSL_RUNTIME_AMENDMENT.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E5_WSL_RUNTIME_AMENDMENT.md)
records a versioned, unapproved `CONDITIONAL` feasibility proposal. It preserves
the native-Windows T09.E1 contract as authoritative while specifying the
split-plane, containerized WSL controls and fresh independent acceptance needed
before WSL could replace it. PR #63 evidence is reused only within its accepted
same-user synthetic scope; no runtime was implemented, no accepted tests were
rerun, and no campaign cell was executed. Status remains **CAMPAIGN BLOCKED —
0/36**.

### T09.E6-E7 closure — container adapter and synthetic image source accepted

T09.E6 implements the bounded Docker CLI isolation adapter while preserving the
public controller and evidence lifecycle interfaces. Its source-level policy,
cleanup classification, and focused regressions are accepted through PR #65;
no real container enforcement was claimed. T09.E7 adds the deterministic static
Linux `amd64` synthetic executable, exact one-stage `scratch` recipe, strict OCI
recipe/metadata validation, and focused source tests accepted through PR #66.
No OCI image or repository digest was produced because no engine was present.
Both closures remain developer-side source evidence, not formal-runtime
acceptance. Status remains **CAMPAIGN BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P0 checkpoint — WSL runtime readiness preflight

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_RUNTIME_PREFLIGHT.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_RUNTIME_PREFLIGHT.md)
records a read-only snapshot at PR #66 baseline. WSL2 `amd64`, the accepted
compiler/linker, cgroup v2, namespace, seccomp, subordinate-ID, ext4, and
overlay/fuse substrate are visible. Container engines, low-level runtimes,
rootless helpers, OCI transport tools, cgroup delegation, and an immutable
`repository@sha256` flow are absent or unavailable to the inspected session.
Actual runtime enforcement and external evaluator/evidence independence remain
not verified. No engine was installed or started, no image was built, and no
container or campaign cell ran. Status is **PROVISIONING REQUIRED / RUNTIME
ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P1 checkpoint — ordinary WSL reconciliation and rootless design

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_ROOTLESS_PROVISIONING_DESIGN.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_ROOTLESS_PROVISIONING_DESIGN.md)
preserves the P0 managed-sandbox snapshot while recording distinct
owner-supplied ordinary WSL observations: systemd is PID 1 and running, cgroup
v2 is `rw,nsdelegate`, ext4 is writable, and engine/rootless/OCI tooling remains
absent. Root-cgroup non-writability does not establish user-service delegation,
which remains unverified. The proposed minimum target is pinned rootless Docker
with a dedicated ext4 layout, systemd-user supervision, explicit rootless Unix
socket, controlled-registry digest flow, and independently verified cgroup and
workspace UID mapping. Two bounded source gaps—explicit socket selection and
mapped-UID workspace access—must be reviewed before acceptance. No version was
invented, no package or host state changed, and no container ran. Status remains
**PROVISIONING NOT AUTHORIZED / RUNTIME ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P2 checkpoint — rootless runtime source compatibility

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md)
implements only the two accepted P1 source gaps. All T09.E6 lifecycle commands
and T09.E7 build/inspect commands now select the exact rootless Unix endpoint
with no inherited Docker context or rootful fallback. The launcher requires a
verified pre-launch workspace receipt produced from injected, validated UID/GID
maps and exact lease-local numeric POSIX ACL application/readback. Access and
default base-group/other permissions are explicitly `---`; only the owner,
mapped workload UID/GID, gateway UID, and mask receive the reviewed `rwx`
permissions. Missing, malformed, additional, inherited or permission-drifted
entries fail before runtime execution. Focused compatibility tests pass 35/35
and directly impacted controller/WSL-lab regressions pass 46/46. These are
source/mock results only: no engine was installed or started, no image was
built, and no container or campaign cell ran. Status is **SOURCE PASS /
ROOTLESS RUNTIME NOT TESTED / FORMAL CAMPAIGN BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P3 checkpoint — controlled provisioning readiness

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P3_PROVISIONING_READINESS.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P3_PROVISIONING_READINESS.md)
records a read-only package/provenance audit at the PR #69 merge baseline.
Ubuntu 26.04/amd64, the 65,536-entry subordinate UID/GID ranges, ext4
repository, overlay substrate, cgroup v2 controllers and systemd packages are
visible. The configured signed Ubuntu archive offers exact snapshot candidates
for `docker.io`, `docker-buildx`, containerd/runc, RootlessKit, slirp4netns,
uidmap and ACL; its simulated minimal closure is 17 new packages, zero upgrades
and zero removals. However the updates/security snapshot is dated 2026-08-10,
Docker CE repository/key/candidates are absent, and
systemd-user/cgroup/socket/ACL/runtime enforcement cannot be verified in this
managed session. No package, source, key, service, daemon, image or container
changed. The original verdict **BLOCKED — PACKAGE SOURCE/LOCK DECISION
REQUIRED** remains historical evidence. The owner addendum dated 2026-10-18
selects official Docker CE as the **SELECTED SOURCE TARGET**; its exact signing
identity, fresh candidates, package digests, dependency closure and lock remain
**NOT VERIFIED**, so the current verdict is **BLOCKED — DOCKER CE
PROVENANCE/PACKAGE LOCK NOT VERIFIED**. Persistent global masking is not
pre-approved: any future rootful auto-start prevention strategy must be
evidence-derived, reversible and separately approved after package
payload/maintainer-script and current unit/dependency ownership inspection.
Global masking of system `containerd.service` or unrelated services is
prohibited without impact evidence and separate approval. Formal campaign
remains **BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P4 checkpoint — Docker CE provenance and partial package lock

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P4_DOCKER_CE_PACKAGE_LOCK.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P4_DOCKER_CE_PACKAGE_LOCK.md)
records bounded acquisition from official Docker CE Resolute/stable/amd64.
Independent fingerprint corroboration, isolated `gpgv` verification, the
signed Release-to-index digest and all five required Docker `.deb` size/hash
bindings pass. Static inspection identifies exact Docker CLI/daemon,
containerd/runc, Buildx and RootlessKit payloads plus maintainer-script actions
that un-mask, enable and request startup of rootful Docker/socket/containerd
units and create the `docker` group. The proposed future control is a separately
approved transaction-scoped service-start guard followed by exact disabling and
verification of only newly package-owned rootful units; persistent/global
masking remains prohibited. The simulation selects 16 new packages, zero
upgrade and zero removal, but 11 Ubuntu archives and the satisfied installed
dependency baseline were not authorized for download and are not byte-locked;
local Ubuntu metadata remains stale. Classification: **PARTIAL — DOCKER CE
PROVENANCE VERIFIED / COMPLETE INSTALLATION LOCK BLOCKED**. No installation,
service change, daemon/container execution or formal cell occurred. Formal
Forge remains **BLOCKED — 0/36**.

### T09.E8.P5 checkpoint — Ubuntu dependency closure and host-relative lock

[AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P5_UBUNTU_DEPENDENCY_LOCK.md](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P5_UBUNTU_DEPENDENCY_LOCK.md)
and its deterministic
[lock manifest](AFYX_FORGE_T09_E8_P5_LOCK_MANIFEST.json) record fresh signed
Ubuntu Resolute base, updates and security metadata plus exact archive-byte
verification for the eleven missing Ubuntu transaction packages. The five P4
Docker CE archives remain byte-identical and were not reacquired. P4's 68
baseline names resolve to 62 installed packages and six virtual/alternative
mappings: all installed packages have exact dpkg state and clean `dpkg -V`
observations, 53 have matching archive hashes in fresh authenticated indexes,
and nine superseded installed versions remain explicitly installed-state only.
An isolated `--simulate --no-download` run selects exactly 16 new packages,
zero upgrades, removals, downgrades or undeclared replacements, and no Ubuntu
Docker/containerd/runc substitute. Classification is **VERIFIED HOST-RELATIVE
TRANSACTION LOCK**; clean-machine reproducibility, installation safety, real
rootless enforcement and independent evaluator/evidence custody are not
claimed. No installation, host mutation, daemon/container execution or formal
cell occurred. T09.E8.P6 remains a separate authorization gate and Formal
Forge remains **BLOCKED — 0/36**.

## Track B — Platform Generalization

V1 scope note (2026-10-27): Track B is required for stable v1. Use the
unambiguous `TB0`–`TB7` labels and crosswalk in the authoritative finalization
contract above; the legacy labels below are preserved for Jira continuity.

Goal:

> Generalize the stable v1 architecture beyond the primary Codex provider without
> leaking provider-specific behavior into Afyx core ownership.

Canonical phases:

- **B0 — v1 Platform Contract Freeze**
- **B1 — Provider-Neutral Core Contracts**
- **B2 — Stable ProviderAdapter Contract**
- **B3 — Capability Discovery / Negotiation**
- **B4 — Provider-Neutral Task / Context / Evidence Contracts**
- **B5 — Additional Provider Integrations by Measured Demand**
- **B6 — Cross-Provider Validation / Hardening**
- **B7 — Stable Generalized Platform**

Preserve the stable Codex integration while generalizing the core.

## Track C — Engineering Intelligence Expansion

Goal:

> Expand from language-level code understanding toward repository, framework,
> data, API/schema, build, runtime, and infrastructure intelligence according to
> measured engineering value.

### C0 — Expansion Evaluation Freeze

Freeze prioritization evidence and avoid language-count driven scope.

### C1 — Repository & Runtime Intelligence

Planned candidates:

- Shell: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`.
- PowerShell: `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1`.
- Make / CMake.
- Dockerfile / Docker Compose.
- generic JSON / JSONC / TOML project manifests.

Target relationships include script -> command, build target -> source/output,
manifest -> dependency/workspace/entrypoint, and runtime/container -> component.

### C2 — Data & Infrastructure Intelligence

Planned candidates:

- PostgreSQL — high priority.
- MySQL / MariaDB.
- SQLite.
- SQL Server / T-SQL.
- Oracle / PL-SQL later.
- GitHub Actions and additional CI/CD by demand.
- Kubernetes.
- Ansible.
- Terraform/OpenTofu enrichment.
- Docker Compose enrichment.
- environment/config relationships.

### C3 — API & Schema Intelligence

Planned candidates:

- GraphQL.
- Protocol Buffers.
- OpenAPI YAML/JSON.
- AsyncAPI later.

Target relationships connect API/schema declarations to implementations,
services, persistence, and runtime components.

### C4 — Deep Framework Intelligence

Priority candidate:

- Odoo engineering relationships across Python models, `_inherit`, fields,
  compute/`@api.depends`, onchange, XML views, buttons/actions/menus,
  `ir.model.access.csv`, record rules, modules, database/migration, and runtime.

Other candidates are selected by measured demand, including Django, FastAPI,
Flask, Spring, Laravel, Rails, React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, SvelteKit, Flutter,
.NET/ASP.NET, and Android.

### C5 — Programming Language Expansion

Candidates include Groovy, Elixir, Zig, F#, Clojure, Haskell, OCaml, Julia,
Perl, and additional languages selected by:

```text
user demand
  x ecosystem value
  x repository prevalence
  / implementation complexity
```

Policy:

> Do not optimize for language-count marketing. Deep engineering-system
> understanding has higher value than low-demand parser breadth.

### C6 — Cross-Domain Relationship Expansion

Unify language, framework, config, database, API/schema, build, and deployment
relationships where evidence shows product value.

### C7 — Real-World Comparative Proof

Measure whether expanded intelligence improves engineering outcomes without
wasting context, tokens, or tool calls.

### C8 — Stable Intelligence Expansion

Freeze supported expansion contracts after evidence and hardening.

## Track D — Afyx Native Engine Optimization

Status: **PLANNED — POST-v1**

Goal:

> Evolve Afyx Graph from an independently reimplemented native engine into an
> evidence-driven, deeply optimized native engine using real production
> workloads rather than historical implementation constraints.

Track D is not a second rewrite of CodeGraph. It starts from Afyx-owned behavior,
architecture, and workload evidence.

Canonical optimization rule:

```text
measure
  -> profile
  -> identify the real bottleneck
  -> redesign/optimize the Afyx-native layer
  -> re-benchmark
  -> retain only quality-safe, material improvements
```

Hard constraints:

- correctness and precision remain hard gates;
- do not optimize by starving context required for a correct result;
- do not reproduce historical architecture merely for parity;
- do not retain benchmark-only complexity whose gain is within noise;
- optimize actual Afyx workloads, including Forge/provider/intelligence usage;
- prefer algorithmic/work-avoidance gains over cosmetic micro-optimization;
- large-repository and workspace scaling is a first-class target;
- token efficiency means maximizing useful information per unit of context and
  eliminating repeated/irrelevant work.

Canonical phases:

- **D0 — Optimization Baseline Freeze**
  - freeze representative post-v1 workloads and reproducible benchmark methods;
  - preserve correctness/output digests and environment metadata.
- **D1 — Production Workload Harvest**

Track D stopping rule:

> Stop when correctness/precision are stable, material bottlenecks have been
> addressed, repeated optimization iterations produce only noise/non-material
> gains, or the next gain would impose disproportionate complexity or
> maintenance cost.

Track D is where Afyx moves beyond **native replacement** into **native
architectural optimization** based primarily on Afyx's own data.

# Long-term intelligence target

The desired post-v1 graph combines:

- language graph.
- framework graph.
- configuration graph.
- database graph.
- API/schema graph.
- build graph.
- deployment/infrastructure graph.

Target:

```text
Language facts
  + framework semantics
  + config relationships
  + database relationships
  + API/schema relationships
  + build relationships
  + deployment/infrastructure relationships
  = Engineering Knowledge Graph
```

Example target for Odoo:

```text
Python model
  -> XML view
  -> button/action
  -> security
  -> related model
  -> database/migration
  -> deployment/runtime context
```

Afyx should understand how the engineering system fits together, not merely
recognize more file extensions.

# Contract governance

## V1 frozen-scope rule

Phase 1 through Phase 11 are frozen as the v1 contract.

A new idea may enter Phase 1–11 only when all are true:

1. it is required to satisfy an already-defined v1 exit gate;
2. excluding it would make an existing v1 claim false or unsafe;
3. it is not merely desirable product expansion;
4. scope and validation impact are explicitly documented.

Otherwise it belongs to the post-v1 expansion program.

## Expansion-track rule

The 2026-10-27 finalization decision brings Track A and Track B into v1 while
preserving their internal gates and identities. Track C and Track D begin only
after the stable v1 boundary unless maintenance of a v1 guarantee requires
otherwise. Execution is prioritized by measured product value while canonical
track identities/order remain fixed.

Canonical dependency intent:

```text
A — Forge
  -> exposes adaptive engineering workloads

B — Platform Generalization
  -> exposes provider-neutral and cross-provider workloads

C — Engineering Intelligence Expansion
  -> broadens language/framework/data/build/runtime workloads

D — Native Engine Optimization
  -> profiles and optimizes the mature Afyx-native engine against those broader
     representative workloads
```

Tracks A/B/C may have limited overlap where dependencies permit; Track D should
consume their mature workload evidence rather than optimize against a narrow,
historical-only fixture set.

## Progress rule

A merge is not sufficient evidence of roadmap completion.

Every substantial task or closure boundary must update the appropriate
source-of-truth document **during the task**, not only at the end:

- the phase-specific evidence document records detailed implementation and
  validation evidence;
- this master roadmap is updated whenever roadmap status, active checkpoint,
  next canonical boundary, contract, or release-relevant state changes;
- status updates must distinguish verified completion, partial completion,
  blocked work, and work merely planned;
- evidence already proven and unaffected by the current dependency/impact cone
  must be reused rather than rerun.

### Task progress contract

Each substantial task must leave a recoverable progress state containing:

- task / roadmap boundary.
- branch and starting HEAD.
- current/final HEAD when available.
- worktree state.
- completed implementation concerns.
- remaining concerns.
- validations completed with exact results.
- validations intentionally not rerun and why.
- failures/skips requiring classification.
- transitional dependencies/artifacts still present.
- exact next action / boundary.
- explicit stop conditions or blockers.

### Session continuity / handoff contract

When a chat/session approaches context or usage limits, is compacted, or is
intentionally continued in a new chat, do **not** restart the engineering task.

Create or preserve a concise handoff checkpoint containing:

```text
repository / branch
starting HEAD
current HEAD
dirty files, if any
completed decisions/implementation
validated evidence that must be reused
unresolved failures/risks
work that is still pending
do-not-repeat validations
exact next action
```

Continuation rules:

1. verify the saved branch/HEAD/worktree;
2. preserve intentional dirty work;
3. reuse valid evidence;
4. rerun only evidence invalidated by subsequent changes or needed to resolve an
   unresolved risk;
5. never reset/restart solely because the chat/session changed;
6. update the phase document and roadmap when the canonical state changes.

This contract exists specifically to prevent token, tool, compute, and human
time waste caused by repeated discovery or validation after session turnover.

Every substantial task must report:

- roadmap phase/sub-boundary.
- baseline SHA.
- branch.
- implementation scope.
- what became genuinely Afyx-native.
- what remains transitional.
- historical implementation removed.
- third-party dependency/license state.
- validation performed.
- regressions/limitations.
- final PR/head when applicable.
- exact next roadmap step.

## Independence vocabulary

Allowed state vocabulary:

- `OPERATIONALLY_AFYX`.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_TRANSITIONAL`.
- `NATIVE_BUT_ARTIFACT_CLEANUP_PENDING`.
- `LICENSE_CLOSURE_PENDING`.
- `AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT`.

Only Phase 5I may authorize:

`AFYX_FULLY_INDEPENDENT`.

### AFYX-268 — Git global-excludes catch-up correctness

Status: **ENGINEERING AND ISOLATED ARTIFACT ACCEPTANCE PASS; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

The retained AFYX-265 fixture proved Git's ground truth for `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and `core.excludesFile`; it also self-healed the suspect global-excludes row on a later reconciliation. A fresh absolute-path source reproduction and a pre-opened QueryPool both stayed correct, so the AFYX-265 console fix and query-worker visibility were not changed. Focused negative regressions then isolated two deterministic incremental-scope defects: repository-relative `core.excludesFile` paths were tested against the process cwd instead of the repository cwd, and the scoped-sync matcher cache omitted the effective global-excludes path/content state. A newly created ignored directory could therefore be admitted after the matcher was warmed, or after the external excludes file changed.

The bounded fix resolves relative paths from the repository root while preserving `~`/absolute handling, and includes the effective excludes path plus mtime/size in scoped matcher invalidation. Existing Git arguments, `windowsHide`, timeouts, stdio, error handling, full-index discovery, MCP lifecycle, and AFYX-265 console-suppression behavior remain unchanged.

Focused evidence: the new global-excludes lifecycle matrix passes 4/4 after failing 2/2 before the fix; it covers initial/full indexing, scoped create/modify/rename/delete, restart/persistence, `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, absolute/relative `core.excludesFile`, unset/missing/non-file configuration, positive files, and supported stale-row reconciliation. Existing extraction ignore checks pass 3/3, watcher info/exclude 1/1, scoped-sync exclusion 1/1, MCP catch-up gate 7/7, and the frozen sync/watcher contract 87/87. TypeScript typecheck, clean production/UI build, semantic baseline 6/6, CLI/MCP smoke 21/21, Afyx identity validation, and legacy-identity audit pass locally. Implementation commit `1c9a9c4dac8b75a3e384509d6f038c2de3720e25` passed [Afyx Graph Build 38130937586](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38130937586) on Windows, Linux, and macOS. An official-bundle-format Windows runtime installed under a disposable `%TEMP%` root reported revision `MATCH`, passed Git-grounded scope/reconciliation/restart acceptance, and passed installed CLI/MCP smoke 21/21. The active installed runtime and MCP configuration were not changed. AFYX-268 engineering acceptance is complete; AFYX-248 remains in progress.

### AFYX-266 — Scoped dependency security remediation

The immutable accepted Alpha candidate remains
`a431ba9ad5fae7bd06329f1fc6e42f1ba503f6dd`; this remediation is confined to
the development branch and requires review before any Alpha promotion.

The authoritative pre-change npm audit reported **10 affected development/build
package records: 2 critical, 5 high, 3 moderate** and **zero production-scope
findings**. The records were Vitest (`GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp`,
`GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9`), `@vitest/mocker` (`GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9`), Tinypool
(`GHSA-5gmw-xhrv-c9v3`, `GHSA-85c8-ppgw-ccpr`), Vite
(`GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9`, `GHSA-v6wh-96g9-6wx3`,
`GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff`), esbuild (`GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99`), PostCSS
(`GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93`, `GHSA-6g55-p6wh-862q`,
`GHSA-fxqj-rqcc-2cmp`, `GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849`), Nanoid
(`GHSA-28wg-ghj8-5hjv`, `GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8`,
`GHSA-xwg4-73v4-xw9w`), Rollup (`GHSA-mw96-cpmx-2vgc`), and
source-map-js (`GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q`).

The smallest compatible dependency closure moves Vitest `2.1.9 -> 4.1.11`,
adds its fixed direct Vite peer at `6.4.3`, and resolves PostCSS
`8.5.6 -> 8.5.29`, Nanoid `3.3.11 -> 3.3.20`, Rollup
`4.57.1 -> 4.64.5`, source-map-js `1.2.1 -> 1.2.2`, and esbuild
`0.21.5 -> 0.25.12`. The vulnerable Tinypool and vite-node records leave the
tree. UI Vite remains `7.3.6` with UI esbuild `0.28.2`; no override is used.
Post-change full and production-only npm audits both report **0 findings**.

Vitest 4 no longer auto-discovers `vitest.workspace.mts`; the equivalent
engine/node and UI/jsdom split now uses `test.projects` in the root config.
The engine keeps its existing isolation and receives a 10-second test budget
for the upgraded runner. Two failure-injection assertions now mutate the
existing mocked functions rather than spying on ESM namespace properties,
preserving their original observable contract under Vitest 4.

Runtime support remains Node `>=22.5.0`. Release builds effectively require
Node `>=22.12.0` because the intentionally retained UI Vite `7.3.6` has that
build-time floor; CI uses Node 24. npm 11 reports the esbuild `0.25.12` and
`0.28.2` install scripts as not approved by `allowScripts`. No script policy or
global npm policy was changed: clean install and clean production/UI build
succeed through the package's optional platform binaries.

Release-critical Actions are pinned to reviewed immutable revisions:
`actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262` (`v4.4.0`),
`actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020` (`v4.4.0`), and
`actions/attest-build-provenance@e8998f949152b193b063cb0ec769d69d929409be`
(`v2.4.0`). Alpha promotion must also retain its already-reviewed
`actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02`
(`v4.6.2`) pin.

Local evidence on the supported contract includes clean install, typecheck and
clean production/UI build PASS; focused Vitest 4 UI **21/21** and git-currency
**13/13** PASS; semantic baseline **6/6** PASS; CLI/MCP smoke **21/21** PASS;
artifact identity/legal **12/12** PASS; component, independence, identity and
legal validators PASS. A historical full local Node 26 run completed
**5647 PASS / 34 FAIL / 31 SKIP**: failures were Windows open-handle cleanup,
load-sensitive timeouts/performance assertions, and one Windows `which`
fixture. Node 26 is inside the published `>=22.5.0` engine range, so AFYX-278
tracks those failures as compatibility defects instead of labeling the runtime
unsupported. Current closure evidence is recorded below; exact-head Node 24
Windows/Linux/macOS CI remains the cross-platform acceptance authority.
Implementation commit `5989661b1444c4f30d37fb1fafddd5ae3023379c`

on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The exact-revision Windows candidate archive

passed bundle/manifest verification and isolated installation: source revision
`MATCH`, release manifest `VERIFIED`, build provenance
`COMMIT_BOUND_MANIFEST`, CLI `1.0.0`, state `HEALTHY`. Publisher authenticity
remains **UNVERIFIED**. AFYX-266 engineering closure is ready for review; it
does not mutate or promote the frozen Alpha candidate and does not replace the
active installed runtime.

# Unified development baseline checkpoint — 2026-10-25

`dev` is the routine development source of truth. The consolidation started from
remote `dev` commit `3b270f2689fc8e2a9b62a9f79ce9a03c3db09700`, whose tree already matches the
accepted Alpha product tree `c352187dcd7e673bda99cd5e92242e24cd2fa77d`.

| Existing work source | Verified disposition |
|---|---|
| Merged Graph, Expert, Forge, ACE, Kit/provider PRs through #101 | Integrated in `dev`; do not replay feature branches. |
| Alpha promotion PR #102 | Product content already matches `dev`; Alpha history remains a release checkpoint. |
| Main PRs #103/#104 | Exact-source build/attestation workflow and artifact layout correction consolidated into `dev`. |
| Main Draft PR #106 | Release-safety behavior consolidated into `dev`; the separate Stable PR remains owner-controlled and unmerged. |
| Main Draft PR #105 | Not integrated. Publication stays default-OFF pending a simpler explicit-owner manual contract. |
| Historical T03/T04 and closed #77/#78 branches | Preserved as evidence/history; their accepted product content is superseded or already present. |
| Detached evaluation/mutation worktrees and Alpha acceptance directories | Evidence only; not development source and not upload candidates. |
| `.afyx-report-staging/`, `debug.log`, ignored indexes/build output, backups, and separate Afyx repositories | Owner/private/runtime state; excluded from `dev`. |

Release workflow consolidation preserves deterministic six-target builds, checksums,
release manifests, immutable action pins, artifact attestations, and downloadable
verification artifacts. Non-publication workflows are read-only and no longer create
tags or GitHub Releases. The previously attested Technical Alpha artifact is not
rebuilt or substituted by this source consolidation.

AFYX-278 reproduced on Windows with Node 26.8.1. The shutdown-control test child used
an isolated home while the parent enumerated the owner's global daemon registry; MCP
fixtures removed temp directories before killed children closed; ArkTS/JVM/C++/PHP
fixtures left Graph or SQLite handles open; the old-Git fixture assumed POSIX `which`;
and Vitest's CPU-derived worker count oversubscribed the Git/SQLite-heavy Windows suite.
The harness now isolates `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`, awaits child close, closes Graph/SQLite
resources, uses a native Windows Git shim, and caps only Windows Node >=26 at four
workers. Product daemon and Graph runtime behavior are unchanged. Focused lifecycle
regression passes 261/261; the final Node 26.8.1 Windows suite passes 325/325 active
files and 5738/5738 active tests, with 4 files and 32 tests intentionally skipped.

Capability work remains nonlinear. Graph reliability and correctness continue first;
Expert D.6 independent review, Forge's formal 0/36 campaign, optional/default-OFF ACE,
and blocked third-party host sessions remain scoped limitations rather than universal
development blockers. Daily installations, customer repositories, credentials, and
runtime indexes remain outside source development.

# Final definition of success

The v1 contract is satisfied only when:

- Afyx implementation is native under the agreed product scope.
- historical implementation retained = 0.
- historical active product identity = 0.
- unwanted third-party product source/assets = 0.
- unwanted third-party bundled runtime = 0.
- unwanted third-party attribution obligation = 0.
- Prompt Master remains external.
- Headroom remains external.
- Codex integration is stable.
- engineering workflow is stable.
- Afyx Graph is usable and hardened.
- Engineering Assurance is usable.
- comparative proof is evidence-based.
- minimum-sufficient context/reasoning/tool/validation behavior is demonstrated.
- large-repository/workspace use does not depend on wasteful whole-repository context by default.
- token/resource efficiency improvements preserve required output quality.
- remaining failed/skipped tests satisfy the classification policy.
- private beta is complete.
- stable release gates pass.

Then, and only then:

> **Afyx Code Engineering Kit v1.0.0 — Stable**

After v1, evolution follows Track A / Track B / Track C / Track D without
reopening the v1 feature contract unless maintenance of an existing v1
guarantee requires it.

### AFYX-280 — Graph discovery coverage and completeness

Status: **ENGINEERING CLOSURE PASS; AFYX-272 MAC.4 REMAINS SEPARATE; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

The AFYX-272 report of four Graph-assisted files versus nine direct-source
declarations is not reproducible as a comparable measurement because the
original query, tool response, result limit, indexed revision, and execution
environment were not recorded. A disposable Git-backed Python fixture at
development baseline `908e56d63ba2e5b38bb557a28e2b88325204f101` established
nine direct `_inherit = 'sale.order'` declarations, multiline syntax, negative
comment/string/unrelated-model cases, and a Git-ignored declaration. Initial
indexing was complete (10 eligible/indexed Python files, 0 failed), and all nine
target files were present in ranked discovery while the ignored file remained
excluded. Literal `sale.order` search also admitted negative metadata matches,
confirming that this command is ranked symbol-metadata discovery rather than an
exhaustive source-declaration query.

The controlled `limit: 4` MCP case confirmed a separate generic presentation
defect: MCP requested exactly four rows and labelled them `4 found`, unlike the
CLI's existing one-extra-row truncation detection. The MCP adapter now fetches
one extra ranked result, renders `N shown`, reports truncation and the supported
limit widening path, and explicitly says ranked symbol search is not an
exhaustive source-declaration inventory. Ranking, extraction, indexing, CLI
JSON shape, and Odoo-specific semantics were not changed. Focused Search/MCP
contract tests, clean typecheck/UI build, semantic baseline, and CLI/MCP smoke
provide the engineering acceptance evidence. No active runtime, MCP
configuration, Alpha branch/candidate, Adit environment, or IJP repository was
modified. Formal AFYX-272 MAC.4 remains unverified and must not be marked PASS
from this investigation.

### AFYX-282 — Native Graph source-intelligence refinement

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; FINAL-HEAD GRAPH BUILD REQUIRED; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

Root cause was layered: the native Python extractor indexed classes and methods but omitted direct class assignments, the Node contract had no structural fact for `_inherit`, ranked FTS search could only return bounded metadata candidates, and default MCP instructions incorrectly encouraged treating ranked exploration as universally exhaustive. The SQLite schema itself was sufficient: source-located `property` nodes with exact class ownership and literal signatures fit the existing node/persistence contract, so no schema migration was introduced. Extraction version advances to 28 so older indexes explicitly request re-indexing.

The new generic Python class-assignment fact supports scalar and multiline list/tuple string literals. Dynamic/aliased expressions remain unresolved and are never converted into invented values. `afyx_graph_inventory` and `afyx-graph inventory` provide exact value matching, project-relative scope, stable source locations, exact totals across declarations/files/modules, bounded pagination, and explicit extraction/failure/skipped/unsupported/ignored/stale coverage. A limited page is labelled incomplete. Existing ranked search/explore behavior remains available for navigation and relationships; default MCP now exposes inventory plus explore and routes hybrid requests to enumerate first.

Owned Odoo-like ground truth covers nine Odoo-17-style declarations and forty-five Odoo-20-style declarations (44 scalar plus one list-form), duplicate class names, multiple declarations per file, multiline values, `_name`, `sale.order.line`, comments/strings, dynamic expressions, ignored and sibling paths, catch-up, create/modify/delete/rename, restart, path refusal, pagination, worker dispatch, and existing ranked-search/explore regressions. These synthetic fixtures validate the product contract only; they are not real IJP/Odoo acceptance, do not establish runtime registry behavior, and do not change AFYX-272 MAC.4.

### AFYX-281 + AFYX-282 — Final engineering acceptance closure

Status: **ENGINEERING ACCEPTANCE PASS; AFYX-248 AND MAC.4 REMAIN IN PROGRESS**

AFYX-281 Linux Graph Build failures (`112.72 ms` and `100.96 ms` against a `100 ms` assertion) retained every functional contract: 500+ true callers, 300 shown, truncation, count parity, uniqueness, and blast-radius parity. Bounded focused reproduction did not demonstrate a product slowdown. The assertion measured loopback HTTP wall time under shared-runner load, which cannot distinguish a batched implementation from N+1 reads. The regression contract now observes the database access shape directly: one focal lookup, one 500-caller batch, and fan-in batches for the 300 displayed rows. Product behavior and thresholds are unchanged.

AFYX-282 had incorrectly incorporated extraction-v28 `_inherit` property facts into the pre-independence semantic snapshot. The historical file is restored byte-for-byte to the digest recorded by `semantic-baseline.meta.json`, with repository attributes pinning its checkout to LF so the same byte identity is enforced on Windows, Linux, and macOS. A separate deterministic additive contract verifies the exact two property facts and two class-containment edges, removes only those additions, and then compares all six fixtures with the unchanged historical oracle. A controlled unrelated TypeScript file-count mutation still fails the historical gate. Canonical `--write` is refused; disposable snapshots require an explicit alternate path.

AFYX-280 boundary validation confirmed `limit + 1` over-fetch and handwritten-before-generated composition. It also reproduced a presentation defect near the shared output bound: a tail-positioned completeness notice could be trimmed. The notice now precedes result rows, so bounded output retains both the ranked-search incompleteness warning and the generic character-truncation marker. Ranking and result composition are unchanged.

Focused regressions, typecheck, clean production/UI build, the six-fixture semantic baseline, 21-check CLI/MCP smoke, identity/component/independence validation, and artifact-identity tests passed. Exact-source-head [Afyx Graph Build 38324265023](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38324265023) passed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. AFYX-281 and AFYX-282 engineering acceptance is complete; this does not activate Technical Alpha or complete AFYX-248 or AFYX-272 MAC.4.

### Repository knowledge catalog acceptance

Status: **ENGINEERING ACCEPTANCE PASS; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

Read-only Odoo 17 evidence confirmed the full-index accounting contract:
93,003 discovered, 42,130 eligible, 42,123 indexed, 6 size-skipped, 50,873
unsupported, and one parser-timeout failure. The previously reported 807
records are not 807 failed files: they contain 901 diagnostics, comprising 800
warning-only `native_incomplete_source` files, six warning-only
`size_exceeded` files, and one error-severity `parse_error` file. Independent
Python AST ground truth found the same nine scoped literal
`_inherit = 'sale.order'` declarations, paths, classes, and lines as Graph.

Inventory coverage now distinguishes scoped Python diagnostics from global
file-record diagnostics and separates error-severity files from warning-only
files. A localized failure outside the requested scope no longer makes a clean
scope look incomplete; any Python extraction diagnostic inside the scope, an
unlocated full-index failure, partial/failed index state, stale extraction, or
bounded page still preserves the conservative limited/partial verdict. Exact
inventory remains static supported-literal evidence rather than the Odoo
runtime registry.

The Odoo 17 dependency file `winerror.py` completed in an isolated one-file
index (7,250 nodes, 7,266 edges, 56.7 seconds), so the prior 60-second timeout
is a load-sensitive large-file limitation rather than a deterministic parser
failure. No timeout or dependency-exclusion policy changed. Its full-index
completion timestamp and a later freshness/sync timestamp remain distinct.

Odoo 17 has an empty/non-functional `.git` directory, so null Git-head
freshness is correctly `UNKNOWN`, not silently fresh. A bounded locking fixture
confirmed WAL readers proceed during an active WAL writer, while an exclusive
MEMORY-journal writer makes a concurrent open fail with `database is locked`;
this is the fresh-build isolation boundary. The Odoo 19 log preserves that
initial open failure and shows successful retry, watcher startup, catch-up,
subsequent syncs, complete index state, zero pending references, and WAL mode.
No writer coordination, daemon lifecycle, schema, parser, ranking, or timeout
change was justified by this acceptance slice.

Implementation commit `8837ea98aa63a4c93a2c15c599f82148ad3320b0`
passed exact-source-head [Afyx Graph Build 38357255978](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38357255978)
on Windows, Linux, and macOS, including clean build, unit tests, semantic
baseline, CLI/MCP smoke, installer verification, identity, attribution, and
operational-independence gates. This closes only the repository-knowledge
engineering acceptance boundary; it does not promote Alpha or complete
AFYX-248.

### Afyx Engineering Expert v0.1.0 — native Kit integration

Status: **IMPLEMENTED; FINAL-HEAD CI REQUIRED; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

The first-party source package
`afyx-engineering-expert-kit-ready-v0.1.0.zip` was accepted only after its
SHA-256 matched
`fe762234d8d21819b53a9963fa37e682635e142d6d4735066f9d692cbeaf0350`.
All 22 safe relative members are strict UTF-8 and the normalized source-tree
digest is
`9ebefe30bf9c7f73b101a53542b3cb09c993cfe9a4d565d15afc5834465569b7`.
The unchanged source tree is bundled as the optional Afyx-owned
`afyx-engineering-expert` 0.1.0 component: one adaptive orchestrator, thirteen
domain references, six workflows, and one result template. No legacy-adoption
claim was created.

PowerShell and Bash lifecycle paths now support explicit install, update,
repair, skip, dry-run/WhatIf, ValidateOnly, verified ownership, transactional
backup/rollback, read-only verifier/doctor reporting, and independently scoped
uninstall. A missing optional Expert installation does not affect core
readiness. Deterministic routing keeps ordinary coding with Efficient Coding,
version-specific Odoo implementation details with Odoo Engineering, and prompt
authoring with Prompt Master; substantive product/architecture, security,
incident/reliability, AI/data, and ERP process advisory can route to Expert.
Simple questions do not route to Expert.

Bundle, component, lifecycle, security, legacy-adoption, doctor, routing,
Graph validator, identity, and evaluation-harness checks pass locally. An
isolated advisory-only Odoo agent run exited successfully, preserved its
fixture, and produced an advisory response. It attempted to read both Expert
and Odoo skill manifests, but the read commands were rejected by the isolated
sandbox before either manifest was loaded; therefore actual functional skill
activation remains **NOT VERIFIED** and is not inferred from response quality
or static routing.

No active skill installation, `CODEX_HOME`, MCP configuration, Graph runtime,
Alpha branch/candidate, PR #59, Adit environment, or IJP repository was
modified. Final-head cross-platform engineering CI remains required before
this integration can be reported complete.

### 2026-10-13 correction — Expert integration, activation evidence, and AFYX-283

Status: **AFYX-284 DONE; AFYX-283 HARNESS REPAIRED / PILOT BLOCKED; AFYX-248 IN PROGRESS**

AFYX-284 native Kit integration is DONE. The implementation and documentation
head `7fab789af6e0e1c122a2744210ca0f13cbfbac01` passed exact-head
[Engineering/Graph Build 38357724286](https://github.com/a5zero7/afyx-codex-engineering-kit/actions/runs/38357724286)
on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This correction supersedes only the earlier
pending-CI wording; it does not alter the accepted 22-file Expert v0.1.0 source.

Functional Activation Smoke Test v2 produced observable host evidence. Case A
successfully read Expert `SKILL.md` but loaded seven domain references and zero
workflows, violating the intended progressive-disclosure boundary; it remains
**FAIL/open**. Case B passed Expert + Odoo Engineering composition. Case C
passed negative routing for a simple Python question. Case D was unnecessary.
Two experimental v0.1.1 refinements still loaded six references and zero
workflows, so they were rejected and reverted; no Expert source optimization is
accepted from those experiments.

AFYX-283 extends the existing Phase 3A JSON harness rather than creating a
parallel evaluator. Historical `environment.json` and result evidence remain
unchanged. The active Expert fingerprint records Efficient Coding 1.2.0, Odoo
Engineering 1.2.0, Expert 0.1.0, verified Prompt Master checkout identity,
Codex 0.156.1, and explicit runtime/permission flags. All four installed Afyx
skills are disabled per session before only the selected frozen configuration
is copied to an external disposable workspace. `X`/`CORE_X` and formal
`A0=N`, `A1=CORE`, `B0=X`, `B1=CORE_X` aliases are defined. Successful
activation now requires observed `SKILL.md` content from a completed host event;
mentions, failed reads, and unavailable events are not treated as activation.

Deterministic isolation/configuration/fingerprint tests and static preflight
pass. The required actual-session evaluator canary timed out twice (180 seconds
and 120 seconds) without any command/read event. It therefore records
**BLOCKED**, not PASS. No development pilot or formal A1/B1 comparison was run.
Until a canary proves evaluator ground truth inaccessible and the bounded pilot
is calibrated, formal comparative acceptance is **BLOCKED**. AFYX-249's formal
Alpha gate is unchanged, and neither AFYX-248 nor Technical Alpha is complete.

### 2026-10-13 AFYX-283B — child diagnostics and actual isolation checkpoint

Status: **HARNESS DIAGNOSTICS REPAIRED / ACTUAL ISOLATION BLOCKED / PILOT NOT RUN**

The original 120–180 second canary timeouts were not evidence of filesystem
denial. A minimal no-skill child showed that the process started, emitted
`thread.started` and `turn.started`, then could not reach the provider inside
the parent network sandbox. The same bounded command with provider access
completed successfully using the frozen `gpt-5.6-sol` / OpenAI / medium
fingerprint. This separates startup and provider health from isolation.

The harness now uses bounded `Popen` execution, preserves redacted partial
JSONL/stderr, classifies startup/authentication/model/network/timeout failures,
and terminates only its owned process tree. The reproduced Windows timeout used
a kill-on-close Job Object and left no owned child running. Pilot mode defaults
to one repetition; benchmark mode retains its three-repetition minimum.

The actual isolation control remains **BLOCKED**. The child runtime rejected
all `exec_command` operations before process creation, including the positive
read of a disposable file inside the authorized repository. Four external
attempts were requested; sandbox-router denial was observed for canary,
manifest and rubric, while the final private-holdout attempt did not complete
before the 45-second bound. No external read succeeded and the randomized
canary value was not exposed, but negative denial without a successful positive
control cannot prove the intended trust boundary. Cleanup completed through the
Windows Job Object. The five DEVELOPMENT pilot scenarios and formal A1/B1 were
not run. The remaining prerequisite is a genuinely restricted execution
boundary (restricted OS account, isolated container, or filesystem ACL) that
allows the evaluated workspace and denies evaluator-only files; Expert v0.1.0
is unchanged.

### 2026-10-13 AFYX-283C.1 — canary/workload parity correction

Status: **DETERMINISTIC CORRECTION IMPLEMENTED / HOST ISOLATION NOT VERIFIED / PILOT NOT RUN**

The AFYX-283B canary and evaluation cells did not use the same workspace
construction: cells ran from `%TEMP%/afyx-eval-*/work`, while the canary ran
under repository-local `evals/results/.isolation-work-*`. The earlier nested
result therefore diagnosed command-policy interference but could not establish
the filesystem boundary used by real evaluation workloads.

AFYX-283C.1 gives cells and canary one shared external disposable-workspace
constructor. The positive attempt flag now derives only from its own observed
tool event. Confirmed evaluator-only read success or canary exposure has `FAIL`
precedence over missing positive evidence, timeout, or other `BLOCKED`
conditions. Bounded execution, redacted evidence, and owned process-tree
cleanup remain unchanged. Deterministic regressions cover workspace parity,
allowed reads, unrelated tool activity, unauthorized reads, marker exposure,
and result precedence.

No direct-host control or DEVELOPMENT pilot was executed from the developer
sandbox. Actual isolation remains **NOT VERIFIED** until the corrected procedure
runs from a trusted PowerShell host and supplies sanitized evidence. Expert
v0.1.0, formal A1/B1, installed components, CODEX_HOME, Graph runtime, PR #59,
the frozen Alpha candidate, and private evaluation material remain unchanged.

### 2026-10-14 AFYX-283C.5 — Windows child launcher and runtime fingerprint repair

Status: **ENGINEERING PASS / DIRECT-HOST ACCEPTANCE PENDING / PILOT NOT RUN**

Independent Windows Terminal evidence identified two concrete defects. Host
Codex was authenticated at 0.162.1, while the frozen fingerprint still declared
0.156.1 and preflight did not verify the installed version. Python resolved the
npm launcher to `codex.CMD` and passed it directly to `Popen(shell=False)`,
producing `WinError 2`; the child never started and the displayed isolation JSON
belonged to an older run.

The runner now dispatches a Windows npm `.CMD` launcher through its sibling
`codex.ps1` using PowerShell `-File` and a discrete argv. No shell command is
constructed, argument boundaries are preserved, and missing safe shim support
fails closed. Direct executable behavior on Linux/macOS is unchanged. Bounded
timeouts and owned process-tree cleanup remain intact.

Codex CLI 0.162.1 passed non-model compatibility checks for the exact harness
flags and command options. A new explicit 0.162.1 runtime fingerprint is active;
the historical 0.156.1 fingerprint and all Expert/skill hashes are preserved.
Frozen preflight now checks the installed CLI version and command contract
before model execution. Child-health and isolation records carry one
`control_run_id`; blocked health overwrites current isolation as
`NOT_EXECUTED`, preventing stale evidence reuse.

No canary or DEVELOPMENT pilot was executed inside the developer sandbox.
Direct-host isolation remains **NOT VERIFIED** until the corrected PowerShell
procedure is run by the user. Expert v0.1.0, installed components, CODEX_HOME,
Graph, PR #59, the frozen Alpha candidate, and customer repositories remain
unchanged.

### 2026-10-14 — AFYX-283C.8 execution boundary correction

Status: **EXECUTION BOUNDARY PASS / DEVELOPMENT PILOT GO (NOT RUN)**.
Independent-host evidence reproduced command-router rejection under legacy
`--sandbox workspace-write`; the positive command never reached CreateProcess,
so generic router denials did not prove filesystem isolation. Codex CLI 0.162.1
passed the official one-command MXC compatibility probe (`MXC_OK`). A disposable
default-deny permission-profile proof established workspace read exit `0` and
evaluator-only sibling read exit `1` (`Access is denied`), with no private marker
exposure, including when both paths were under OS temp.

The harness now selects an explicit root-deny, minimal-runtime-read,
workspace-write, temp-deny, network-disabled permission profile and native MXC
on Windows. Legacy `--sandbox` is removed because it disables permission-profile
mode. Historical fingerprints and Expert v0.1.0 hashes remain unchanged.

The exact host harness then passed child/provider health, a completed command
event, the workspace read, and all four evaluator-only denials. No unauthorized
read, canary exposure, timeout, or orphan cleanup occurred. A direct MXC write
control also created a workspace file while evaluator-only write failed and
created nothing. The positive read uses its absolute workspace path because
the first corrected run proved the permission boundary but also showed that
the child command's relative working-directory assumption was false.

The accepted architecture uses a trusted host-side evaluator controller and
two disjoint MXC roots: one disposable root for the evaluated agent and one
development root for any developer agent. The private holdout/rubric root is
outside both and denied by the same root-deny profile. The controller alone
retains ground truth. A1 and B1 must use the identical profile and permissions.
No real holdout, DEVELOPMENT pilot, or formal A1/B1 was run in this checkpoint.
Focused regression and exact-head CI remain engineering closure gates.

### 2026-10-14 — AFYX-283D.2 pilot evidence review

Status: **PILOT REVIEW PROVISIONAL / PROVENANCE BLOCKED / FORMAL A1-B1
BLOCKED**. The accessible independent-host control evidence is fresh and
correlated: child health `PASS`, isolation `PASS`, matching control
`718a0a8d0aff49f6b6a9a6d28ad71f5f`, positive workspace read `PASS`, four
negative controls denied, no external read or canary exposure, command tool
observed, no timeout, and cleanup `PASS`. The active manifest selects the Codex
0.162.1 MXC fingerprint. Five fresh scenario records eventually completed, but
none stores the controlling `control_run_id`; the required record-to-isolation
correlation therefore cannot be proven.

Substantive visible-output review: Architecture, Security, and
Database/Reliability are technically coherent, bounded advisory responses and
activate Expert with relevant references. ERP/Odoo gives strong Odoo 17,
company, quantity, idempotency, retry, and concurrency guidance, but reads only
Odoo Engineering; the required Expert composition is absent. Negative Routing
correctly gives a concise Python list-reversal answer with zero skill/tool reads;
its automated `FAIL` is a keyword-assertion false negative. No scenario modifies
fixtures, times out, reports a failed tool, or claims executed validation.

Observed progressive disclosure is improved but does not close the historical
Case A defect: Architecture reads Expert plus three domain references and one
workflow; Security reads Expert plus three references; Database reads Expert,
three references, and one workflow. The earlier seven-reference load remains an
open regression target until repeated evidence demonstrates resolution.

Provider counters across five records: input `218169`, cached input `176768`,
output `11628`, reasoning `1741`, derived input+output `229797`, derived uncached
input `41401`, wall time `231.03s`, and 17 command/read tool calls. Provider
`total_tokens` is absent and is not inferred as a billing total.

Optimization decision: no Expert source change in this review. P0 is evidence
integrity—persist `control_run_id` and atomically publish complete/failure records.
P1 is ERP composition routing so Expert orchestrates the cross-disciplinary
analysis while Odoo Engineering owns version-specific facts. P2 retains the
progressive-disclosure regression gate and reduces reference loading only when
quality is preserved. P3 replaces brittle exact-keyword acceptance with semantic
or structured checks while preserving negative-routing exclusion. Protected
rubrics and holdouts were not imported into the developer boundary. Formal A1/B1
remains blocked until provenance is repaired and the affected DEVELOPMENT cases
are rerun once.

### 2026-10-14 — AFYX-283D.3 evaluation provenance closure

Status: **ENGINEERING CORRECTION IMPLEMENTED / DEVELOPMENT PILOT NOT RERUN /
FORMAL A1-B1 BLOCKED**.

The D.2 records confirmed an evidence-integrity defect: fresh child-health and
isolation controls shared `control_run_id` `718a0a8d0aff49f6b6a9a6d28ad71f5f`,
but no scenario `result.json` stored that identity. The records therefore remain
historical, substantively reviewable evidence whose control-to-cell provenance
is explicitly **UNVERIFIED**; they are not retroactively promoted.

The Phase 3A harness now creates one `evaluation_run_id` before child health and
uses the same value as `control_run_id`. It passes the immutable correlation
context through function arguments into child health, isolation, every cell,
and the aggregate summary. The context records exact repository revision,
benchmark-subject commit, frozen-environment path and SHA-256; each cell also
records scenario, resolved configuration, repetition, and seed. This shared
UUID proves record correlation only, not cryptographic attestation. A mixed run
is rejected and a legacy record without the ID remains `UNVERIFIED`.

Control, cell, and summary JSON publication now uses a same-directory temporary
file plus `os.replace`, with temporary cleanup on success or failure. The
summary starts as `INCOMPLETE`, records the last completed and attempted cells,
and becomes `COMPLETE` only after every planned cell finalizes and all control
and cell identities match. A pre-finalization exception creates a correlated
`INCOMPLETE` cell with a bounded error classification and cannot leave an
apparently complete summary.

The Negative Routing prompt and forbidden-skill boundary are unchanged. Its
brittle `output_contains('[::-1]')` assertion is replaced by a bounded,
AST-whitelisted Python semantic check. It accepts slicing, `list(reversed(...))`,
and in-place `list.reverse()` when execution yields the actual reversed fixture,
rejects incorrect, irrelevant, and merely hard-coded alternatives, and requires
zero tool calls in addition to zero Expert, Efficient Coding, Odoo Engineering,
or Prompt Master reads.

No Expert v0.1.0 source changed. Existing activation evidence supports a future
ERP composition correction, not a conclusion that the harness missed a read:
the ERP scenario observably loaded Odoo Engineering only. The smallest
remediation hypothesis is to clarify discovery ownership so Expert orchestrates
genuinely cross-disciplinary requirements, risk, architecture, and acceptance
work, while Odoo Engineering owns Odoo-version-specific ORM, company, and
transaction facts. Acceptance requires the unchanged cross-disciplinary ERP
scenario to observably load both skills with bounded Expert disclosure, while a
narrow Odoo question continues to route to Odoo Engineering without forcing
Expert. That hypothesis is preparation only and needs a separately authorized
source change and fresh DEVELOPMENT rerun. The earlier seven-reference Case A
progressive-disclosure defect remains open. No model evaluation or formal A1/B1
was run in D.3.

### 2026-10-14 — AFYX-283D.4 Expert/Odoo composition candidate

Status: **v0.1.1 CANDIDATE PREPARED / INDEPENDENT-HOST DEVELOPMENT RERUN
REQUIRED / FORMAL A1-B1 BLOCKED**.

The D.2 ERP record observably read Odoo Engineering and did not read Expert.
The source-level cause is overlapping discovery ownership: Odoo Engineering's
description directly matches Odoo implementation and process work, while
Expert v0.1.0 listed ERP among broad capabilities but did not state when a
cross-disciplinary ERP review needs Expert orchestration or how responsibilities
compose. This was not an activation-observation defect.

Candidate v0.1.1 changes only Expert discovery/composition text and its version
label within the 22-file skill. Expert owns cross-disciplinary problem framing,
process invariants, architecture alternatives, risks, and acceptance strategy;
Odoo Engineering retains release-specific ORM, multi-company/security,
model/view, transaction, and implementation facts. Narrow Odoo implementation
questions may continue to use Odoo Engineering without Expert. Composition is
not permission to broaden context: Expert still starts with one primary domain
and no more than two supporting domains, loads the ERP workflow only for a
material multistep process review, and expands only for a concrete dependency
or risk.

The candidate skill source commit is
`8df29c3f9e31aa4661cc1e7d6f80328096e3f1ce`, content SHA-256 is
`06d947c595f164ed1ad94e8ef97aa412a3ec7559c5f79cb467f0ec1ad488095c`,
and normalized 22-file tree SHA-256 is
`40cfa1f8b4fe3743a7eca81f8e4eb76c879d7adcd650c33b5611b0a2775ea138`.
The selected candidate environment is
`environment-expert-v0.1.1-codex-0.162.1-mxc.json`. Historical v0.1.0
fingerprints remain unchanged and retain content SHA-256
`69f85c93dbab28fb11460b0a9a2bbc38dbcf9c04f02747af7199ba84077334db`
and original normalized source-tree SHA-256
`9ebefe30bf9c7f73b101a53542b3cb09c993cfe9a4d565d15afc5834465569b7`.

Zero-token routing fixtures cover cross-disciplinary ERP composition, narrow
Odoo exclusion, simple Python negative routing, and general architecture,
security, database, reliability, and AI/data routing. The unchanged DEVELOPMENT
ERP prompt still requires observable reads of both Expert and Odoo Engineering
and forbids fabricated database/module execution claims. These deterministic
contracts do not prove actual model routing. Expert v0.1.1 remains a candidate
until a fresh independent-host DEVELOPMENT run with D.3 provenance observes
the intended composition and bounded disclosure. The historical Case A
seven-reference regression remains open; no pilot or formal A1/B1 was run here.

### 2026-10-15 — T06 Expert D.6 substantive-review preparation

Status: **BLOCKED — REVIEW PREPARED / SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW NOT EXECUTED**.

Developer-side preparation correlated Expert `0.1.1` subject revision
`8df29c3f9e31aa4661cc1e7d6f80328096e3f1ce`, content SHA-256

`799d34b5934928606954b6fb19b3f8b834e010224a558c85cdfcd527dd48e926`.
The five D.5 records retain automated PASS and observed routing/operational
counters, but no sanitized independent-review verdict was available. The
developer session did not open owner-only raw responses, events, rubrics,
canaries, or holdouts and did not act as the substantive evaluator.

ERP/Odoo observably selected Expert plus Odoo Engineering, and Negative Routing
selected no skill and used no tools. Those facts do not prove substantive
correctness, task fidelity, evidence quality, or security. The historical Case
A seven-reference progressive-disclosure defect remains `OPEN`; narrow Odoo-only
exclusion is `NOT TESTED`. Candidate source and historical v0.1.0/v0.1.1
fingerprints remain unchanged. T07 formal A1/B1 is blocked until an independent
owner-controlled evaluator returns a sanitized, identity-bound `KEEP`, `REVISE`,
or `REJECT` conclusion. No model run, candidate freeze, Alpha promotion, release,
or Jira status change occurred.

### 2026-10-19 — Phase 7 Engineering Assurance candidate

Status: **IMPLEMENTED / FOCUSED LOCAL VALIDATION PASS / STACKED REVIEW AND
EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING**.

Phase 7 is stacked on Phase 6 PR #79 exact HEAD
`b7fddb76264244803d723cca5537f9e2ddc0238c`; PR #79 remains Draft and unmerged.
Its CI run `39227026045` is independently observed SUCCESS on Windows, Linux, and
macOS. The previously reported 25 native-Windows Forge POSIX/WSL environment
errors remain historical FAIL evidence. Separate owner-provided isolated Windows
installation evidence was not attributable in the available public PR record and
is therefore `NOT VERIFIED`, not inferred.

The frozen-v1 preset amendment removes Prompt Master from Minimal, Recommended,
Full, normal verification, and implicit legacy update/repair paths. Prompt Master
remains an upstream-owned EXTERNAL Custom component; existing user state is
preserved and explicit acquisition retains pinned provenance, backup, rollback,
and offline fail-closed behavior. This retirement does not claim a Forge-native
replacement.

The lightweight machine-readable engineering-assurance contract validates the
schema of self-declared Task, Baseline, Scope, Ground Truth, risk Levels 1/2/3,
adaptive validation budget,
conditional mutation/differential/performance proof, failed/skipped classification,
evidence reuse, CI, documentation, and merge readiness. Unknown status, stale or
mismatched evidence, unjustified skip, out-of-scope change, and required-v1 failure
all fail closed. Canonical repository-relative paths reject traversal, absolute,
drive-qualified, UNC, and malformed input before allowlist matching. Affirmative
Ground Truth requires PASS evidence; negative observations are separately classified.
Source/diff/CI identities still require independent verification before acceptance.
Correctness and security remain higher priority than performance or efficiency. The
lifecycle remains `PLANNED → ANALYZED → IMPLEMENTED → VALIDATED
→ DOCUMENTED → MERGE_READY`.

Focused evidence at implementation time is component contract PASS,
engineering-assurance 13/13 PASS, and control-plane 11/11 PASS. The current
native-Windows scripts suite executed 240 tests with zero assertion failures and 15
environment errors in the same synthetic-image/WSL-container/WSL-lab Forge modules;
it remains `FAIL`, separate from the historical 25-error run. Exact-head CI,
independent review, owner merge decisions, and retargeting after Phase 6 merge remain
pending. Active runtime, Alpha, T05 Adit, and T09 Forge campaign were not changed;
T09 remains `BLOCKED — 0/36` and A8 remains without GO.

## AFYX-290 — Native Afyx Context Engine Foundation

Status: **REVIEW CORRECTIONS IMPLEMENTED; NEW EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING**

The first ACE MVP is an independently runnable, Afyx-owned package under
`afyx-context/`. It provides conservative protected-content classification,
exact-repeat reduction, bounded selection with byte-complete fallback, stable
owner/session-bound references, original retrieval, provenance, and independent
CLI/API entry points. Graph, Engineering Expert, Forge, and Kit are represented
only through the versioned optional `ace.integration/v1` contract; their
standalone behavior does not depend on ACE and no default Kit preset changes.

The deterministic synthetic baseline and complete provenance/limitation record
are maintained in `docs/AFYX_CONTEXT_ENGINE_FOUNDATION.md`. External Headroom
A/B, real consumer adapters, multi-process writers, and Kit lifecycle delivery
remain outside this foundation and must not be inferred as complete.

The bounded review correction moves optional-adapter request validation inside
its failure boundary and preserves malformed input through `originalInput`.
Explicit request, CLI, identity, metadata, blob, session-content, and provenance
limits close the standalone MVP's unbounded-input paths. Storage commits blobs
and metadata through owned temporary files with `fsync` and rename, preflights
existing blob integrity before new writes, adopts a complete interruption orphan
on retry, and leaves truncated metadata unchanged while failing closed. The
focused suite passes 22 tests. Fresh exact-head CI remains required; the prior
`4f5abc1` CI does not attest these corrections.

## AFYX-291 — Native ACE comparative benchmark and acceptance

Status: **BENCHMARK EXECUTED; STACKED DRAFT REVIEW AND EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING**

AFYX-291 is isolated on a benchmark-only branch from frozen ACE foundation
`594452d4722d4135ef04643639c1ad16c2c5e681`; Draft PR #84 and its dogfood
worktree remain unchanged. Eight synthetic fixtures and seven cold plus seven
warm repetitions per fixture produce 112 process samples with pinned
`js-tiktoken` 1.0.21 `o200k_base` measurement. Correctness, protected-content,
owner/session boundary, fallback, passthrough, exact recovery, and deterministic
output checks pass.

The evidence explicitly retains zero-saving outcomes and a recovery-heavy net
regression: 76.14% cold gross reduction becomes -21.92% net after every emitted
reference is recovered. Therefore no general savings claim is made. Headroom
0.37.0 comparison is `BLOCKED` and its A/B is `NOT_RUN`: the installed boundary
is a provider proxy/evaluation surface rather than an equivalent standalone
transform, and active routing, credentials, private sessions, and global state
were not used. Full methods and raw evidence are recorded in
`docs/AFYX_CONTEXT_ENGINE_AFYX_291_BENCHMARK.md` and
`docs/evidence/afyx-291/`.

## AFYX-292 — Native ACE multi-process coordination and crash-safe local state

Status: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VALIDATED; STACKED DRAFT REVIEW AND EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING**

AFYX-292 extends the standalone ACE store with one bounded exclusive lock per
local state root. Atomic lock-directory creation, state/owner binding, token-checked
release, and conservative same-host PID-presence checks protect concurrent first
initialization, same-session writers, cross-session shared blobs, and retrieval.
Abandoned ownership is reclaimed only after defensible liveness verification;
age, PID alone, malformed metadata, and foreign artifacts never authorize
deletion. Interrupted session commits retain the prior metadata, while complete
content artifacts are adopted only after digest verification.

Focused deterministic child-process tests cover concurrency, contention,
hard-kill recovery, invisible partial commits, exact retrieval, release after
failure, and ambiguous lock evidence. The full contract and limitations are in
`docs/AFYX_CONTEXT_ENGINE_AFYX_292_COORDINATION.md`. Real Graph/MCP consumers,
distributed coordination, authentication, deployment, and preset activation
remain separate future boundaries.

## 2026-10-26 — AFYX-249 Alpha entry readiness reconciliation

This checkpoint corrects current state without rewriting the historical gate
observations above.

- `dev` is `640d3a00ef9a7cb079f811b75c09bae3ff60c0ca` (tree
  `970023696a6b05b9a84a83ccea01fe5c3d4c66b7`); exact-head Repository CI is
  green on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- `alpha` remains the frozen Technical Alpha source
  `077abe19cadd861e676b6b2c14a229d11a0a5717` (tree
  `c352187dcd7e673bda99cd5e92242e24cd2fa77d`). Its accepted six-target
  artifact/attestation evidence remains immutable and available; it does not
  attest later `dev` changes.
- AFYX-248 and its accepted IJP testing children, AFYX-289, AFYX-58/59, and
  AFYX-62/63 no longer represent open Alpha-entry defects. Their declared
  limitations remain in force.
- No current evidence demonstrates an ordinary-use P0/P1 defect in the
  declared Technical Alpha contract. Expert D.6 independent review, the Forge
  campaign, the Adit physical macOS pilot, optional ACE, provider-host
  authentication/quota limitations, and deferred graphical UI remain outside
  the universal entry gate unless their capability is explicitly claimed.
- The frozen artifact is suitable only for the frozen `077abe19...` release
  contract. Promoting unified `dev` requires a distinct reviewed candidate and
  new exact-source build/attestation; prior installed-host evidence may be
  reused only for unchanged behavior.
- Public publication remains separate from product readiness. Draft PR #106
  contains the fail-closed legacy Stable workflow correction, while Draft PR
  #105 contains guarded Technical Alpha publication preparation. Neither is
  merged. Publication stays disabled pending an explicit owner decision and a
  proportionate owner-controlled Build -> Test -> Verify -> Release path.

Current disposition: **CONDITIONAL**. No automatic promotion, tag, release,
publication workflow dispatch, or branch rewrite is authorized by this
checkpoint.

## 2026-10-26 — AFYX-283 Case A reference-disclosure gate

Status: **MEASUREMENT DEFECT CORRECTED / CASE A RERUN NOT RUN / D.6 BLOCKED**.

The accepted D.5 records exposed only aggregate `read_calls`; result records
left `files_opened`, `unique_files_opened`, and `duplicate_reads` unavailable.
The harness therefore could report automated PASS without enforcing the Expert
contract of one primary and at most two supporting references. This is a
reproducible harness defect, not evidence that Expert response quality failed or
that the host/model will always over-load references.

The bounded correction extracts successful Expert reference and workflow paths
from completed tool events, stores only normalized skill-relative names and
counts, and gives the Architecture scenario a fail-closed maximum of three
unique Expert references. Missing path telemetry is recorded as unavailable and
fails the gate rather than being reported as an observed zero. Failed reads do
not count as loaded content; duplicates and Windows path-case differences do not
inflate the unique count.
No Expert skill source, frozen v0.1.1 identity, prompt, rubric, provider,
installed runtime, or owner-only evidence changed.

Deterministic positive, negative, duplicate, failed-read, Windows-path, manifest,
and routing regressions pass. Actual Case A model execution remains `NOT_RUN` in
this correction. AFYX-283 remains `ACCEPTANCE_PENDING`: the next acceptance step
is an authorized isolated Architecture rerun proving at most three observed
Expert references, followed by the already-required independent D.6 substantive
`KEEP`, `REVISE`, or `REJECT` verdict. Formal A1/B1 remains blocked by D.6.

## 2026-10-31 — TASK F-P01 Afyx Forge Core v0.1 Fast Track Delivery

Status: **FORGE CORE ALPHA RUNTIME DELIVERED; FORMAL CAMPAIGN REMAINS EVALUATION_GATED (0/36 NOT_RUN)**.

Afyx Forge has been productized into a standalone native runtime (`afyx-forge` CLI/API v0.1.0) delivering proportional adaptive engineering policies and actionable structured guidance (investigation priorities, tool recommendations, validation scopes, explicit completion criteria) for real day-to-day software engineering tasks across 6 observable task strata.

Key architectural boundaries:
- **Assistive Guidance Mode:** Operates strictly within deterministic analysis and guidance generation. No uncontrolled model execution or autonomous destructive file mutation.
- **Adaptive Tool Routing:** Graph exploration is recommended ONLY when cross-module changes or inheritance structures materially benefit from it; fallback to direct-source is guaranteed. Context Engine remains default-OFF (opt-in only).
- **Safety Boundary & Bounded Execution:** Requests containing force-push, review bypass, secret extraction, or arbitrary destructive operations are fail-closed with status `REFUSED_UNSAFE`.
- **Governance Gate Preservation:** The formal Forge B0–B5 comparative evaluation campaign (36 cells) and A8 architectural promotion gate remain strictly `EVALUATION_GATED` (0/36 NOT_RUN). Forge Core Alpha does NOT weaken or prematurely declare A8 as accepted.
- **Installer Integration:** Integrated into `install.ps1` as an explicitly selectable runtime component under `-Preset custom -CustomComponent @('afyx-forge')` with transactional swap, health validation, update, and clean uninstall capabilities.
