# AFYX-58/59 — Alpha-critical security and recovery closure

Date: 2026-10-21  
Baseline: `2d2875c5fd2e4adf677f65e8eb31c18921d03397`  
Scope: normal Technical Alpha use; no Alpha activation or runtime deployment

## Disposition

| Area | Result | Evidence and residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AFYX-58 Alpha-critical security | PASS (bounded scope) | Existing path/ownership, command, MCP, artifact-identity, tamper, and lifecycle guards passed affected regression. A disposable Windows ZIP traversal probe was rejected by `Expand-Archive` without an escaped write. Production dependency audit reports 0 advisories. Full audit reports one high `vite` advisory confined to the development/build dependency and `launch-editor`; it is not reachable from the installed CLI/MCP artifact. Publisher authenticity remains independently unverified where no external attestation exists. This is not a comprehensive security assessment of every development surface. |
| AFYX-59 Alpha-critical recovery | PASS after correction | Init/index, interrupted sync state, corrupt-index rebuild, stale/live locks, WAL healing/deferral, database-handle lifecycle, and transactional lifecycle regressions passed. The verified P1 was an interrupted Graph runtime swap: both official installers used a random backup name that a later retry could not discover. |
| AFYX-249 handoff | CONDITIONAL / separate owner decision | No verified open P0/P1 remains in this bounded AFYX-58/59 scope. Alpha entry still requires owner reconciliation of all other gate evidence and declared limitations; this report does not grant Alpha GO. |

## Correction

Both official Graph installers now use the deterministic sibling recovery path
`<runtime-root>.afyx-old`. Before an install/update retry they:

1. restore a missing runtime only when the recovery metadata proves Afyx Graph ownership;
2. refuse foreign/unverified recovery state;
3. refuse the ambiguous case where runtime and recovery paths both exist;
4. keep validation and uninstall non-mutating while interrupted state exists; and
5. retain rollback to the prior runtime when staging, swap, or post-swap verification fails.

No Graph engine semantics, index format, user corpus, active runtime, MCP registration,
PATH, or global configuration changed.

## Validation

- Python lifecycle/artifact matrix: 19/19 PASS.
- Graph security/recovery matrix: 402 PASS, 5 platform-conditional skips.
- Full-index recovery suite, including an unreadable/corrupt SQLite file: 6/6 PASS.
- Clean TypeScript/UI production build: PASS.
- CLI/MCP smoke: 21/21 PASS.
- Identity, component, Engineering Assurance, and legacy-identity validators: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: 0 production vulnerabilities across 3 production dependencies.
- `npm audit`: 1 high development-only `vite` advisory; no production finding.

The interrupted-swap regression constructs the exact owned post-interruption filesystem
state rather than killing an installer process at an instruction boundary. It proves retry,
non-mutating validation, ownership preservation, and ambiguous-state refusal on Windows;
Linux/macOS shell behavior remains subject to exact-head CI.

## Jira-ready update

AFYX-58: bounded Alpha-critical security closure PASS; no production-reachable dependency
advisory or verified P0/P1 found. Keep the development-only `vite` advisory and unattested
publisher authenticity as declared residuals. AFYX-59: P1 interrupted Graph installer swap
fixed with deterministic ownership-checked recovery and fail-closed ambiguous-state handling;
affected recovery evidence passes. AFYX-249: reassess separately after exact-head three-OS CI;
do not infer Alpha GO from this closure alone.
