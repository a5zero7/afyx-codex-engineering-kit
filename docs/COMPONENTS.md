# Afyx Component Guide

This guide describes the executable source tree, not a target architecture. The
canonical lifecycle inventory is [`scripts/components.json`](../scripts/components.json).
Historical reports remain useful evidence, but they do not override that contract
or the current implementation.

## Afyx Graph

### Purpose

Afyx Graph is local structural code intelligence. It discovers eligible files,
extracts supported declarations and relationships, stores them in SQLite, and
exposes repository evidence through a CLI, an optional MCP server, and a local
viewer.

### Available capabilities

- Initialize, rebuild, sync, and report separate Git/content/extraction health.
- Search declarations and inspect a symbol with caller/callee context.
- Explore a concept with bounded source and call paths.
- Enumerate supported Python class assignments with explicit coverage/pagination.
- Analyze structural impact and select affected tests.
- Serve the `afyx_graph` MCP with tools named `afyx_graph_*`.
- Use project-local `.afyx-graph/` state or a bound external state directory.
- Run daemon/MCP lifecycle and local viewer routes.

Basic operation:

```bash
afyx-graph init /absolute/project --yes
afyx-graph status /absolute/project
afyx-graph query MySymbol --path /absolute/project --json
afyx-graph explore "MySymbol request lifecycle" --path /absolute/project --max-files 5
afyx-graph impact MySymbol --path /absolute/project --depth 2
afyx-graph affected --path /absolute/project src/service.ts
```

For exact supported Python inventory:

```bash
afyx-graph inventory _inherit sale.order --path /absolute/project --scope addons
```

### State and configuration

The default effective state is `<project>/.afyx-graph`. `AFYX_GRAPH_DIR` changes
only that project-relative directory name. For a read-only corpus, set
`AFYX_GRAPH_STATE_DIR` to an absolute external directory before every CLI/MCP
invocation:

```powershell
$env:AFYX_GRAPH_STATE_DIR = 'D:\AfyxState\project-a'
afyx-graph init 'D:\Source\project-a' --yes
```

```bash
export AFYX_GRAPH_STATE_DIR="$HOME/.local/state/afyx/project-a"
afyx-graph init "$HOME/src/project-a" --yes
```

External state is bound to exactly one canonical project root. Empty, relative,
overlapping, aliased, foreign, malformed, or cross-project locations fail closed;
there is no silent fallback into the source tree.

Kit installation may configure the Codex MCP entry through the native `codex mcp`
interface. Use `-SkipGraphMcp` / `--skip-graph-mcp` to prevent this. To inspect a
provider snippet without writing configuration, use:

```bash
afyx-graph install --print-config codex
```

### Validation and limitations

Use `afyx-graph status` before relying on results. A `STALE`, incomplete,
unsupported, skipped, or ignored coverage dimension must remain visible in the
engineering conclusion. Graph is static structural evidence: runtime dispatch,
generated behavior, database state, permissions, and tests still require their
own evidence. Markdown and generic JSON are catalogued as metadata rather than
structurally indexed content.

Troubleshooting:

- `not initialized`: run `init` for the exact project/state pairing.
- `STALE`: inspect pending changes, then run `sync` only when updating that index
  is intended.
- external-state ownership/path error: verify absolute canonical containment and
  `project.json`; do not delete or rebind foreign state automatically.
- MCP unavailable: run the Kit verifier and distinguish not configured, blocked,
  and failed handshake states.
- daemon shutdown/startup issue: preserve lock/registry evidence; do not kill a
  process based on PID alone.

Detailed implementation notes are in the [Graph README](../afyx-graph/engine/README.md).

## Afyx Engineering Expert

### Purpose and capabilities

Engineering Expert is one adaptive instruction skill, not 13 simultaneous agents.
It chooses a primary discipline and initially at most two supporting disciplines
from product, analysis, architecture, UX, software, AI/data, ERP, security,
reliability, database, and QA guidance. Six optional workflows cover discovery,
implementation, debugging, review, incident/reliability, and AI/data/ERP work.

Invoke it explicitly for substantive cross-disciplinary work:

```text
Use afyx-engineering-expert to review this payment-service change. Establish the
requirements, trust boundary, failure modes, data impact, and acceptance tests.
```

It composes with Efficient Coding for implementation and with Odoo Engineering
for release-specific Odoo facts. Graph is optional repository intelligence, not
an activation dependency.

### Installation, validation, and limitations

It is installed by Recommended/Full or explicit component selection. Open a new
host session and verify it appears in the skill picker or invoke its exact name.
The skill has no runtime dependency, implicit network access, or hidden download.

It is an evidence-oriented instruction system, not a production certification.
Final Expert D.6 substantive acceptance, broad SME sign-off, and universal
framework expertise are not claimed. When repository or runtime evidence is
missing, its conclusions must say so.

Troubleshooting: remove duplicate same-named skill copies across user/project
scope, reopen the host session, and verify the installed `SKILL.md` metadata.
See the [Expert README](../skills/afyx-engineering-expert/README.md).

## Afyx Forge

### Current implemented scope

Forge is the evaluation and assurance foundation under `evals/forge/`. The source
tree includes:

- versioned manifests and candidate composition;
- public deterministic engineering fixtures;
- pristine-fixture and campaign-readiness validation;
- a controller library with evidence binding/finalization contracts;
- Windows/WSL/container isolation prototypes and regression tests;
- synthetic-image preparation with pinned policy and dependency evidence.

Safe source-level validation that does not run a model:

```bash
python evals/forge/validate.py --check-fixtures
python evals/forge/validate.py --print-order-digest
python evals/forge/validate.py --campaign-ready
```

The last command is expected to fail closed while mandatory campaign blockers
remain. Do not interpret fixture validation as an authorized evaluator campaign.

### Maturity and limitations

Forge is **not** an installed Kit runtime and is not part of normal onboarding.
Its candidate matrix/public contract are prepared, while owner-approved runtime,
isolation, provider/model, budget, and private/evaluator boundaries remain gated.
The canonical manifest reports the campaign as blocked and prepared executable
paths as not run. Native production acceptance and a fully executed comparative
campaign are therefore not claimed.

Start with the [Forge A0–A3 contract](AFYX_FORGE_A0_A3_CONTRACT.md) and
[T09 readiness](AFYX_FORGE_T09_P0_READINESS.md). Campaign execution requires a
separate explicit authorization and exact environment identity.

## Afyx Context Engine

### Purpose and capabilities

ACE is a standalone local Node.js API/CLI for conservative reduction and
byte-exact recovery. It stores originals in a content-addressed state root,
verifies digests on retrieval, serializes local writers, and recovers only when
same-host process evidence safely proves a stale lock.

```bash
afyx-context reduce --state /absolute/owned/state --owner owner-a \
  --session source-sha --input request.json --budget 16000
afyx-context get --state /absolute/owned/state --owner owner-a \
  --session source-sha --reference 'ace:v1:...'
```

API usage and input limits are documented in the [ACE README](../afyx-context/README.md).

### Kit and Graph integration

ACE lifecycle is `managed-optional`. It is absent from Minimal, Recommended, and
Full and must be selected explicitly:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Preset custom -CustomComponent afyx-context -Confirm:$false
```

```bash
./install.sh --preset custom --custom-component afyx-context
```

The `ace.integration/v1` optional-consumer contract and
`graph.ace.consumer/v1` bridge retain the complete Graph result as authoritative
fallback. Graph integration is default OFF and is not enabled by installation.

### Limitations and troubleshooting

ACE does not guarantee a context or token reduction. Unique/small content and a
recovery exchange can be net-negative. Protected diagnostic, security, and
source-evidence content remains inline. Coordination is local, not distributed;
state is plaintext and the operator owns access control and retention.

On `LOCK_TIMEOUT` or `LOCK_RECOVERY_UNSAFE`, inspect the recorded process/host
and preserve ambiguous artifacts. Do not delete a lock solely because it is old.
Owner/session mismatch and corrupt content fail closed by design.

## Efficient Coding

Efficient Coding 1.2.1 is a quality-first implementation workflow:
`GROUND → LOCATE → REPRODUCE → CHANGE → VALIDATE → REPORT`. It routes known-file
work directly, uses structural intelligence only when relationships matter, and
expands validation according to risk.

It is a core skill in every implicit preset and has no runtime dependency. Invoke
it for coding, debugging, refactoring, or code investigation—not general chat or
prompt-writing tasks. Validation still depends on the target repository's actual
toolchain. See [`skills/efficient-coding/SKILL.md`](../skills/efficient-coding/SKILL.md).

## Odoo Engineering

Odoo Engineering 1.2.0 provides version-aware source guidance for Odoo 10–20,
including ORM, models, views, reports, security, migrations, and debugging. It
selects exactly one target major version from repository/runtime evidence and
loads only that reference (or source plus target for migration work).

It is a core skill in every implicit preset. “Stable references” does not mean
every project customization is known: inspect inheritance, enterprise/community
edition, installed modules, ACL/rules, runtime registry, and database behavior
when material. See [`skills/odoo-engineering/SKILL.md`](../skills/odoo-engineering/SKILL.md).

## Kit installer, updater, verifier, and doctor

The Kit uses one component/control-plane contract across PowerShell and Bash.

| Surface | Role | Mutation |
|---|---|---|
| `install.ps1` / `install.sh` | Inventory, desired-state plan, staged install/repair/update | Only after selected/confirmed action |
| `update.ps1` / `update.sh` | Clean fast-forward self-update, then component lifecycle | Yes; dirty checkout stops before install |
| `verify.ps1` / `verify.sh` | Validate installed desired state and optional capabilities | No |
| `scripts/afyx-doctor.*` | Report host/component/project diagnostics | No |
| `uninstall.ps1` / `uninstall.sh` | Remove only ownership-verified selected components | Yes |

State is one of `NOT INSTALLED`, `HEALTHY`, `INCOMPLETE`, `INVALID`, `DRIFTED`,
or `UNKNOWN`. Foreign/unknown targets are preserved. Preview, ownership,
transaction, backup, rollback, and recovery behavior is detailed in the
[Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md).

## Usage Tracking

Usage Tracking is an optional Windows-only local toolset installed under the
Codex tools directory. It consumes Codex session events and can display a summary
through the global Stop hook; a VS Code watcher is retained for fallback/debug.
Full selects it on Windows and marks it not applicable on Linux/macOS.

It estimates token categories and API-equivalent cost from available local
events and a pricing table. It is not provider-authoritative billing, does not
reconstruct unavailable data, and can report partial/unavailable fields. Review
and trust hooks explicitly. See [Usage Tracking](CODEX_USAGE_TRACKER.md).

## Optional host integrations

- **Codex MCP:** Graph registration is optional, consented, and managed through
  the native Codex CLI. Conflicting/unproven entries are preserved.
- **ChatGPT Skills:** Expert can be packaged manually where account/workspace
  policy supports Skills upload. Kit installation does not perform that upload.

Provider, credentials, model, proxy, unrelated MCP entries, and external product
state are outside the Kit's ownership boundary. Retired external integrations
are not discovered or managed; existing user-owned installations remain untouched.
