# Afyx Engineering Expert — v0.1.1

A single portable Agent Skill with 13 selectively loaded specialist references and 6 optional workflows. Its goal is adaptive, evidence-based product and software engineering across technologies, including ERP when relevant. No external scripts, runtime dependencies, MCP requirement, code borrowed from other projects, or implicit network access.

## Content

- `SKILL.md` — skill manifest, activation/routing, adaptive execution, quality contract.
- `references/*.md` — 13 distinct scopes, methods, outputs, anti-patterns.
- `workflows/*.md` — process guidance read only for matching tasks.
- `assets/result-template.md` — optional reviewer-ready result format.

## Codex CLI / VS Code

Copy the **folder** `afyx-engineering-expert` into your user skill directory, commonly `$HOME/.agents/skills/` (on Windows PowerShell: `$HOME\.agents\skills\`), or into the project's `.agents/skills/` for repo-scoped installation. Avoid duplicating a same-named copy across scopes. Verify discovery using the available skill picker or invoke `$afyx-engineering-expert`; re-open the Codex session if necessary. Refer to your installed Codex version's skill path when in doubt.

Example PowerShell from the directory containing the extracted folder:

```powershell
$dest = Join-Path $HOME '.agents\skills'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dest -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force '.\afyx-engineering-expert' $dest
```

## ChatGPT

Where the **Skills** feature and upload permission are enabled for your account/workspace, go to Plugins > Skills > Create > Upload from computer and upload the ZIP containing this single top-level folder. Uploading/installation depends on account eligibility and workspace policy, and was **not** performed as part of this bundle. If Skills is unavailable on your account, use `SKILL.md` as a reference when drafting Project or custom instructions; this is not equivalent to installing the skill.

## Usage examples

- `Gunakan afyx-engineering-expert untuk audit arsitektur dan threat model pada layanan ini.`
- `Implementasikan perubahan berikut di repo; pilih domain relevan saja, uji negative dan regression paths.`
- `Tinjau workflow purchase-to-pay pada ERP versi yang ada, termasuk hak akses dan dampak akuntansi.`
- `Rancang evaluasi fitur AI berbasis dokumen dan jelaskan risiko kebocoran data.`

## Design notes

This is an original, instruction-only draft. It does not claim real production testing, framework-specific certification, or real-world SME signoff. Review installation and validate activation/output within each platform before broad rollout.
